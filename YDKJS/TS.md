TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript with the potential
to solve many of the headaches for which JavaScript is
famous. But TypeScript has a learning curve of its own,
and understanding how to use it effectively takes time and
practice. Using the format popularized by Effective C++ and
Effective Java (both Addison-Wesley), this practical book
features 83 items that give specific advice on what to do
and what not to do, and how to think about the language.
```
```
Author Dan Vanderkam shows you how to apply each item’s
advice through concrete examples. This book will help you
advance from a beginning or intermediate user familiar with
TypeScript basics to an expert who knows how to use the
language well.
```
```
Updated for TypeScript 5, this second edition includes
two new chapters on type-level programming and
TypeScript recipes.
```
**-** Learn the nuts and bolts of TypeScript’s type system
**-** Use type inference to get full safety with a minimum
    of type annotations
**-** Design types to make your code safer
    and more understandable
**-** Model complex APIs using generic types
    and type-level programming
**-** Understand how dependencies and
    type declaration files work in TypeScript
**-** Successfully migrate your JavaScript code base
    to TypeScript

```

```
```
Effective TypeScript’s second edition is a marvelous addition to an already excellent book.
It combines the great tips and tricks from the first edition with deep suggestions on
TypeScript practices that have only solidified over the last few years. The knowledge here
is a must-have for working with TypeScript on any project size. I particularly appreciated
that many recommendations include nuance around when and why they apply.
```
I would encourage any developer who wants to be deeply proficient at writing TypeScript

```
to give this book two enthusiastic read-throughs and take detailed notes.
```
```
—Josh Goldberg, open source developer
and author of Learning TypeScript
```
```
Effective TypeScript is not just a guide to one of the world’s most popular programming
languages. At its core, it teaches you how to think in types with applicable real-world
advice. You can see Dan’s experience oozing from every single page. It’s daring! And will
potentially change your view on programming beyond TypeScript.
```
```
—Stefan Baumgartner, senior product architect, Dynatrace,
and author of TypeScript Cookbook
```
```
Effective TypeScript, 2nd ed., is a great companion book for engineers who are already
familiar with the basics of TypeScript and are writing it day-to-day,
or are considering adopting TypeScript for their codebase.
```
```
—Boris Cherny, author of Programming TypeScript
```

```
I’ve been engaged with TypeScript for over 10 years, both in teaching and professional
practice. Effective TypeScript offers sound advice that aligns well with my experience.
The book effectively highlights how understanding TypeScript’s syntax is one thing,
but knowing when to use its features is another. It’s a helpful guide for those who are
familiar with TypeScript but want to refine their use of its capabilities.
```
```
—Titian-Cornel Cernicova-Dragomir,
software engineer at Bloomberg LP
```
```
This book is packed with practical recipes and must be kept on the desk
of every professional TypeScript developer. Even if you think
you know TypeScript already, get this book and you won’t regret it.
```
```
—Yakov Fain, Java champion
```
```
This book is not just about what TypeScript can do—it teaches why each language feature
is useful, and where to apply patterns to get the greatest effect. The book focuses on
```
practical advice that will be useful in day-to-day work, with just enough theory to give the

```
reader a deep understanding of how everything works. I consider myself to be an
advanced TypeScript user, and I learned a number of new things from this book.
```

### Preface to the Second Edition

It’s hard to believe it’s been nearly five years since the first edition of Effective

TypeScript was published. The book and its companion website have both been well

received and have helped countless developers improve their understanding and

usage of the language.

I was surprised how quickly I began to get asked whether the book was out-of-date. It

only took six months! Given the pace of change in TypeScript in the years leading up

to the first edition, this was a real concern of mine. I tried to avoid printing material

that would soon be out-of-date. This meant focusing more on timeless topics like lan‐

guage fundamentals and program design, rather than on libraries and frameworks.

By and large, the material in Effective TypeScript has held up well.

As TypeScript developed and gained new features, it didn’t invalidate the first edition

as much as it created gaps in its coverage. Writing an “effective” item requires more

than just knowing how a feature works. It requires experience using that feature: time

spent learning which patterns work well and which ones don’t hold up. Conditional

types had only recently been added to the language in 2019, so I had little experience

with them. They’re covered more extensively in this edition. Template literal types

have been the biggest addition to TypeScript in the past five years. They’ve opened

whole new worlds of possibilities and are covered in Item 54.

Moreover, thanks to projects like the Type Challenges, TypeScript developers have

become much more ambitious in what they do in the type system. Generics and type-

level programming were covered only lightly in the first edition. Now they get an

entire chapter, Chapter 6.

```

```

More than eight years after I first tried TypeScript, I continue to enjoy it and get exci‐

ted every time I read the latest release notes or see an ambitious new PR from Anders

Hejlsberg making the rounds. I also continue to enjoy helping other developers learn

TypeScript and improve their usage of it. I hope that comes across in these pages, and

I hope that reading this book helps you enjoy working in TypeScript as much as I do!

#### Who This Book Is For

The Effective books are intended to be the “standard second book” on their topic.

You’ll get the most out of Effective TypeScript if you have some previous practical

experience working with JavaScript and TypeScript. My goal with this book is not to

teach you TypeScript or JavaScript but to help you advance from a beginning or inter‐

mediate user to an expert. The items in this book do this by helping you build mental

models of how TypeScript and its ecosystem work, making you aware of pitfalls and

traps to avoid, and by guiding you toward using TypeScript’s many capabilities in the

most effective ways possible. Whereas a reference book will explain the five ways that

a language lets you do X, an Effective book will tell you which of those five to use and

why.

TypeScript has evolved rapidly over the past few years, but my hope is that it has sta‐

bilized enough that the content in this book will remain valid for years to come. This

book focuses primarily on the language itself, rather than any frameworks or build

tools. You won’t find any examples of how to use React or Vue with TypeScript, or

how to configure TypeScript to work with webpack or Vite. The advice in this book

should be relevant to all TypeScript users.

#### Why I Wrote This Book

When I first started working at Google, I was given a copy of the third edition of

Effective C++ by Scott Meyers (Addison-Wesley Professional). It was unlike any other

programming book I’d read. It made no attempt to be accessible to beginners or to be

a complete guide to the language. Rather than telling you what the different features

of C++ did, it told you how you should and should not use them. It did so through

dozens of short, specific items motivated by concrete examples.

The effect of reading all these examples while using the language daily was unmistak‐

able. I’d used C++ before, but for the first time I felt comfortable with it and knew

how to think about the choices it presented to me. In later years I would have similar

experiences reading Effective Java by Joshua Bloch (Addison-Wesley Professional)

and Effective JavaScript by David Herman (Addison-Wesley Professional).

**xii | Preface to the Second Edition**


If you’re already comfortable working in a few different programming languages,

then diving straight into the odd corners of a new one can be an effective way to chal‐

lenge your mental models and learn what makes it different. I’ve learned an enor‐

mous amount about TypeScript from writing this book. I hope you’ll have the same

experience reading it!

#### How This Book Is Organized

This book is a collection of “items,” each of which is a short technical essay that gives

you specific advice about some aspect of TypeScript. The items are grouped themati‐

cally into chapters, but feel free to jump around and read whichever ones look most

interesting to you.

Each item’s title conveys the key takeaway. These are the things you should remember

as you’re using TypeScript, so it’s worth skimming the table of contents to get them in

your head. If you’re writing documentation, for example, and have a nagging sense

that you shouldn’t be writing type information, then you’ll know to read Item 31:

Don’t Repeat Type Information in Documentation.

The text of the item expands on the advice in the title and backs it up with concrete

examples and technical arguments. Almost every point made in this book is demon‐

strated through example code. I tend to read technical books by looking at the exam‐

ples and skimming the prose, and I assume you do something similar. I hope you’ll

read the prose and explanations! But the main points should still come across if you

skim the examples.

After reading the item, you should understand why it will help you use TypeScript

more effectively. You’ll also know enough to understand if it doesn’t apply to your sit‐

uation. Scott Meyers, the author of Effective C++, gives a memorable example of this.

He met a team of engineers who wrote software that ran on missiles. They knew they

could ignore his advice about preventing resource leaks, because their programs

would always terminate when the missile hit the target and their hardware blew up.

I’m not aware of any missiles with JavaScript runtimes, but the James Webb Space

Telescope has one, so you never know!

Finally, each item ends with “Things to Remember.” These are a few bullet points that

summarize the item. If you’re skimming through, you can read these to get a sense for

what the item is saying and whether you’d like to read more. You should still read the

item! But the summary will do in a pinch.

```
Preface to the Second Edition | xiii
```

#### Conventions in TypeScript Code Samples

All code samples are TypeScript except where it’s clear from the context that they are

JSON, HTML, or some other language. Much of the experience of using TypeScript

involves interacting with your editor, which presents some challenges in print. I’ve

adopted a few conventions to make this work.

Most editors surface errors using squiggly underlines. To see the full error message,

you hover over the underlined text. To indicate an error in a code sample, I put squig‐

gles in a comment line under the place where the error occurs:

```
let str = 'not a number';
let num: number = str;
// ~~~ Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'
```
I occasionally edit the error messages for clarity and brevity, but I never remove an

error. If you copy/paste a code sample into your editor, you should get exactly the

errors indicated—no more, no less.

To draw attention to the lack of an error, I use // OK:

```
let str = 'not a number';
let num: number = str as any ; // OK
```
You should be able to hover over a symbol in your editor to see what TypeScript con‐

siders its type. To indicate this in text, I use a comment with Twoslash syntax (^?):

```
let v = {str: 'hello', num: 42};
// ^? let v: { str: string; num: number; }
```
The comment indicates what you’d see in your editor if you moused over the symbol

above the caret (^). This matches the convention used on the TypeScript playground.

If you copy a code sample over there and drop everything after the ^?, TypeScript will

fill in the rest for you. What you see on the playground (Figure P-1) should precisely

match what you see in print.

Figure P-1. Twoslash syntax on the TypeScript playground.

**xiv | Preface to the Second Edition**


I will occasionally introduce no-op statements to indicate the type of a variable on a

specific line of code:

```
function foo(value: string | string []) {
if (Array.isArray(value)) {
value;
// ^? (parameter) value: string[]
} else {
value;
// ^? (parameter) value: string
}
}
```
The value; lines are only there to demonstrate the type in each branch of the condi‐

tional. You don’t need to (and shouldn’t) include statements like this in your own

code.

Unless otherwise noted or clear from context, code samples are intended to be

checked with the --strict flag. While printed copies of a book don’t change, Type‐

Script does, and it’s inevitable that some of the types or errors in code samples will be

different in the future. Check the Effective TypeScript repo for updated versions of

the examples in this book. All samples were verified with literate-ts using TypeScript

5.4.

#### Typographical Conventions Used in This Book

The following typographical conventions are used in this book:

Italic

Indicates new terms, URLs, email addresses, filenames, and file extensions.

Constant width

```
Used for program listings, as well as within paragraphs to refer to program ele‐
ments such as variable or function names, databases, data types, environment
variables, statements, and keywords.
```
**Constant width bold**

Shows commands or other text that should be typed literally by the user.

_Constant width italic_

```
Shows text that should be replaced with user-supplied values or by values deter‐
mined by context.
```
```
This element signifies a tip or suggestion.
```
```

#### Acknowledgments

Despite my hopes, writing a second edition did not prove any easier or less time-

consuming than the first. In the process, the book has grown from 62 items to 83. In

addition to writing 22 new items (one old item was consolidated into another), I’ve

reviewed and thoroughly revised all the original material. Some parts, such as Items

45 and 55 , are near complete rewrites.

Many new items are based on material that first appeared on the Effective TypeScript

blog, though all of these have seen significant revision. Chapter 6 is largely based on

my personal experiences building the crosswalk and crudely-typed libraries for Delve

at Sidewalk Labs.

Here are the origins of the new items in the second edition:

- Item 28 is adapted from the blog post “Use Classes and Currying to Create New
    Inference Sites”.
- Item 32 arose from code reviews. I didn’t know this was a rule until I saw it
    broken!
- Item 36 was inspired by feedback I’ve given on countless code reviews.

```
Preface to the Second Edition | xvii
```

- Item 37 is based on personal experience and Evan Martin’s blog post “Why Not
    Add an Option for That?”. Cory House’s frequent tweets on this topic gave me
    courage to include it in the book.
- Item 38 was inspired by the Alan Perlis quote, which I frequently cite, as well as
    by Scott Meyers’s rule.
- Item 39 is based on my team’s experience with the Jsonify adapter, which we
    were excited to adopt and then even more excited to ditch. The experience led to
    the blog post “The Trouble with Jsonify: Unify Types Instead of Modeling Small
    Differences”.
- Item 48 is adapted from the blog post “The Seven Sources of Unsoundness in
    TypeScript” with significant input from Ryan Cavanaugh.
- Item 50 was inspired by lots of thinking about what types really are, and a Stack
    Overflow answer explaining dependent types.
- Item 51 is an adaptation of the blog post “The Golden Rule of Generics”, which
    is, in turn, an adaptation of advice in the TypeScript handbook.
- Item 53 was inspired by my work on crosswalk and crudely-typed, and curiosity
    about all those [T] wrappers I was seeing.
- Item 54 was inspired by my own explorations of template literal types after Type‐
    Script 4.1 was released, which culminated in the blog post “TypeScript Splits the
    Atom!”.
- Item 56 is the culmination of my long-standing interest in this topic. This was
    kicked off by Titian Cernicova-Dragomir’s answer to a Stack Overflow question
    about typing _.invert, followed by my own experiences in crosswalk and
    crudely-typed, which eventually led to the blog post “The Display of Types”.
- Item 57 was inspired by the release notes for TypeScript 4.5, which added tail
    recursion.
- Item 58 was inspired by experience connecting TypeScript with databases that
    eventually led to my TypeScript Congress 2022 talk: “TypeScript and SQL: Six
    Ways to Bridge the Divide”.
- Item 59 presents a widespread trick that Jesse Hallett introduced me to while
    reviewing the first edition. The “pairs” variation comes from a 2021 tweet by Tom
    Hicks.
- Item 62 was inspired by an Artsy blog post: “Conditional Types in TypeScript”.
- Item 63 originated with Ryan Cavanaugh’s feedback on the first edition, which I
    eventually distilled into a blog post: “Exclusive Or and the Optional never Trick”.
    Stefan Baumgartner’s enthusiasm for this trick in the TypeScript Cookbook
    (O’Reilly) encouraged me to include it in the book.

**xviii | Preface to the Second Edition**


- Item 71 was inspired by a discussion with Evan Martin on reddit and a frustrat‐
    ing bug that came back to new Set("string"). This led to the blog post “In
    Defense of Interface: Using Declaration Merging to Disable ‘Bad Parts’”.
- Item 74 is a topic that comes up frequently, especially if you don’t have the right
    mental model of TypeScript.
- Item 76 was inspired by countless debugging sessions that came back to an incor‐
    rect model of your environment.
- Item 77 was inspired by personal curiosity about this topic, a few Stack Overflow
    questions, and a Gary Bernhardt talk.
- Item 78 was inspired by painful personal experience with TypeScript getting slow.
    It’s based on the TypeScript wiki and the blog post “What’s Typescript Compil‐
    ing? Use a Treemap to Find Out”.

### Preface to the First Edition (2019)

In the spring of 2016, I visited my old coworker Evan Martin at Google’s San Fran‐

cisco office and asked him what he was excited about. I’d asked him this same ques‐

tion many times over the years because the answers were wide-ranging and

unpredictable but always interesting: C++ build tools, Linux audio drivers, online

crosswords, emacs scripts. This time, Evan was excited about TypeScript and Visual

Studio Code.

I was surprised! I’d heard of TypeScript before, but I knew only that it was created by

Microsoft and that I mistakenly believed it had something to do with .NET. As a life‐

long Linux user, I couldn’t believe that Evan had hopped on team Microsoft.

Then Evan showed me VS Code and the TypeScript playground and I was instantly

converted. Everything was so fast, and the code intelligence made it easy to build a

mental model of the type system. After years of writing type annotations in JSDoc

comments for the Closure Compiler, this felt like typed JavaScript that really worked.

And Microsoft had built a cross-platform text editor on top of Chromium? Perhaps

this was a language and toolchain worth learning.

I’d recently joined Sidewalk Labs and was writing our first JavaScript. The codebase

was still small enough that Evan and I were able to convert it all to TypeScript over

the next few days.

I’ve been hooked ever since. TypeScript is more than just a type system. It also brings

a whole suite of language services which are fast and easy to use. The cumulative

effect is that TypeScript doesn’t just make JavaScript development safer: it also makes

it more fun!

#### Acknowledgments to the First Edition

There are many people who helped make this book possible. Thanks to Evan Martin

for introducing me to TypeScript and showing me how to think about it. To Douwe

Osinga for connecting me with O’Reilly and being supportive of the project. To Brett

Slatkin for advice on structure and for showing me that someone I knew could write

an Effective book. To Scott Meyers for coming up with this format and for his “Effec‐

tive Effective Books” blog post, which provided essential guidance.

To my reviewers, Rick Battagline, Ryan Cavanaugh, Boris Cherny, Yakov Fain, Jesse

Hallett, and Jason Killian. To all my coworkers at Sidewalk who learned TypeScript

with me over the years. To everyone at O’Reilly who helped make this book happen:

Angela Rufino, Jennifer Pollock, Deborah Baker, Nick Adams, and Jasmine Kwityn.

To the TypeScript NYC crew, Jason, Orta, and Kirill, and to all the speakers. Many

items were inspired by talks at the Meetup, as described in the following list:

- Item 3 was inspired by a blog post of Evan Martin’s that I found particularly
    enlightening as I was first learning TypeScript.
- Item 7 was inspired by Anders’s talk about structural typing and keyof relation‐
    ships at TSConf 2018, and by a talk of Jesse Hallett’s at the April 2019 TypeScript
    NYC Meetup.
- Both Basarat’s guide and helpful answers by DeeV and GPicazo on Stack Over‐
    flow were essential in writing Item 9.
- Item 10 builds on similar advice in Item 4 of Effective JavaScript.
- I was inspired to write Item 11 by mass confusion around this topic at the August
    2019 TypeScript NYC Meetup.
- Item 13 was greatly aided by several questions about type vs. interface on Stack
    Overflow. Jesse Hallett suggested the formulation around extensibility.
- Jacob Baskin provided encouragement and early feedback on Item 15.
- Item 18 was inspired by several code samples submitted to the r/typescript
    subreddit.
- Item 24 is based on my own writing on Medium and a talk I gave at the October
    2018 TypeScript NYC Meetup.
- Item 29 is based on common advice in Haskell (“make illegal states unrepresenta‐
    ble”). The Air France 447 story is inspired by Jeff Wise’s incredible 2011 article in
    Popular Mechanics.
- Item 30 is based on an issue I ran into with the Mapbox type declarations. Jason
    Killian suggested the phrasing in the title.

**xxii | Preface to the First Edition (2019)**


- The advice about naming in Item 41 is common, but this particular formulation
    was inspired by Dan North’s short article in 97 Things Every Programmer Should
    Know (Kevlin, Henney, O’Reilly).
- Item 64 was inspired by Jason Killian’s talk at the very first TypeScript NYC
    Meetup in September 2017.
- Item 25 is based on the TypeScript 2.1 release notes. The term “evolving any” is
    not widely used outside the TypeScript compiler itself, but I find it useful to have
    a name for this unusual pattern.
- Item 46 was inspired by a blog post of Jesse Hallett’s.
- Item 47 was greatly aided by feedback from Titian Cernicova-Dragomir in Type‐
    Script issue #33128.
- Item 49 is based on York Yao’s work on the type-coverage tool. I wanted some‐
    thing like this and it existed!
- Item 66 is based on a talk I gave at the December 2017 TypeScript NYC Meetup.
- Item 52 owes a debt of gratitude to David Sheldrick’s post on the Artsy blog on
    conditional types, which greatly demystified the topic for me.
- Item 70 was inspired by a talk Steve Faulkner, aka southpolesteve, gave at the
    February 2019 Meetup.
- Item 55 is based on my own writing on Medium and work on the typings-
    checker tool, which eventually got folded into dtslint.
- Item 72 was inspired/reinforced by Kat Busch’s Medium post on the various types
    of enums in TypeScript, as well as Boris Cherny’s writings on this topic in Pro‐
    gramming TypeScript (O’Reilly).
- Item 60 was inspired by my own confusion and that of my coworkers on this
    topic. The definitive explanation is given by Anders on TypeScript PR #12253.
- The MDN documentation was essential for writing Item 75.
- Chapter 10 is based on my own experience migrating the aging dygraphs library.

I found many of the blog posts and talks that led to this book through the excellent r/

typescript subreddit. I’m particularly grateful to developers who provided code sam‐

ples there which were essential for understanding common issues in beginner Type‐

Script. Thanks to Marius Schulz for the TypeScript Weekly newsletter. While it’s only

occasionally weekly, it’s always an excellent source of material and a great way to keep

up with TypeScript. To Anders, Daniel, Ryan, and the whole TypeScript team at

Microsoft for the talks and all the feedback on issues. Most of my issues were misun‐

derstandings, but there is nothing quite so satisfying as filing a bug and immediately

seeing Anders Hejlsberg himself fix it!

**CHAPTER 1**

### Getting to Know TypeScript

Before we dive into the details, this chapter helps you understand the big picture of

TypeScript. What is it and how should you think about it? How does it relate to Java‐

Script? Are its types nullable or are they not? What’s this about any? And ducks?

TypeScript is an unusual language in that it neither runs in an interpreter (as Python

and Ruby do) nor compiles down to a lower-level language (as Java and C do).

Instead, it compiles to another high-level language, JavaScript. It is this JavaScript that

runs, not your TypeScript. So understanding TypeScript’s relationship with JavaScript

is essential and will help you be a more effective TypeScript developer.

TypeScript’s type system also has some unusual aspects that you should be aware of.

Later chapters cover the type system in much greater detail, but this one will hit a few

of the most important highlights.

You should read this chapter even if you’ve already written lots of TypeScript. It will

help you build correct mental models of what TypeScript is and how its type system

works, and it may clear up some misconceptions you didn’t realize you had.

### Item 1: Understand the Relationship Between TypeScript and JavaScript

If you use TypeScript for long, you’ll inevitably hear the phrase “TypeScript is a

superset of JavaScript” or “TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript.” But what does

this mean, exactly? And what is the relationship between TypeScript and JavaScript?

Since these languages are so closely linked, a strong understanding of how they relate

to each other is the foundation for using TypeScript well.

##### 1


```
1 You may run across .tsx, .jsx, .mts, .mjs, and a few other extensions. These are all TypeScript and JavaScript
files.
```
A is a “superset” of B if everything in B is also in A. TypeScript is a superset of Java‐

Script in a syntactic sense: so long as your JavaScript program doesn’t have any syntax

errors then it is also a TypeScript program. It’s quite likely that TypeScript’s type

checker will flag some issues with your code. But this is an independent problem.

TypeScript will still parse your code and emit JavaScript. (This is another key part of

the relationship. We’ll explore this more in Item 3.)

TypeScript files use a .ts extension, rather than the .js extension of a JavaScript file.^1

This doesn’t mean that TypeScript is a completely different language! Since Type‐

Script is a superset of JavaScript, the code in your .js files is already TypeScript.

Renaming main.js to main.ts doesn’t change that.

This is enormously helpful if you’re migrating an existing JavaScript codebase to

TypeScript. It means that you don’t have to rewrite any of your code in another lan‐

guage to start using TypeScript and get the benefits it provides. This would not be

true if you chose to rewrite your JavaScript in a language like Java. This gentle migra‐

tion path is one of the best features of TypeScript. There will be much more to say

about this topic in Chapter 10.

All JavaScript programs are TypeScript programs, but the converse is not true: there

are TypeScript programs that are not JavaScript programs. This is because TypeScript

adds additional syntax for specifying types. (There are some other bits of syntax it

adds, too, largely for historical reasons. See Item 72.)

For instance, this is a valid TypeScript program:

```
function greet(who: string ) {
console.log('Hello', who);
}
```
But when you run this through a program like node that expects JavaScript, you’ll get

an error:

```
function greet(who: string) {
^
```
```
SyntaxError: Unexpected token :
```
The : string is a type annotation that is specific to TypeScript. Once you use one,

you’ve gone beyond plain JavaScript (see Figure 1-1).

**2 | Chapter 1: Getting to Know TypeScript**


Figure 1-1. All JavaScript is TypeScript, but not all TypeScript is JavaScript.

This is not to say that TypeScript doesn’t provide value for plain JavaScript programs.

It does! For example, this JavaScript program:

```
let city = 'new york city';
console.log(city.toUppercase());
```
will throw an error when you run it:

```
TypeError: city.toUppercase is not a function
```
There are no type annotations in this program, but TypeScript’s type checker is still

able to spot the problem:

```
let city = 'new york city';
console.log(city.toUppercase());
// ~~~~~~~~~~~ Property 'toUppercase' does not exist on type
// 'string'. Did you mean 'toUpperCase'?
```
You didn’t have to tell TypeScript that the type of city was string: it inferred it from

the initial value. Type inference is a key part of TypeScript, and Chapter 3 explores

how to use it well.

One of the goals of TypeScript’s type system is to detect code that will throw an

exception at runtime, without having to run your code. When you hear TypeScript

described as a “static” type system, it refers to this ability. The type checker cannot

always spot code that will throw exceptions, but it will try.

Even if your code doesn’t throw an exception, it still might not do what you intend.

TypeScript tries to catch some of these issues, too. For example, this JavaScript

program:

```
Item 1: Understand the Relationship Between TypeScript and JavaScript | 3
```

```
const states = [
{name: 'Alabama', capital: 'Montgomery'},
{name: 'Alaska', capital: 'Juneau'},
{name: 'Arizona', capital: 'Phoenix'},
// ...
];
for ( const state of states) {
console.log(state.capitol);
}
```
will log:

```
undefined
undefined
undefined
```
Whoops! What went wrong? This program is valid JavaScript (and hence Type‐

Script). And it ran without throwing any errors. But it clearly didn’t do what you

intended. Even without adding type annotations, TypeScript’s type checker is able to

spot the error and offer a helpful suggestion:

```
for ( const state of states) {
console.log(state.capitol);
// ~~~~~~~ Property 'capitol' does not exist on type
// '{ name: string; capital: string; }'.
// Did you mean 'capital'?
}
```
We did, in fact, mean capital with an “a.” States and countries have capital (“a”) cit‐

ies, whereas legislatures meet in capitol (“o”) buildings.

While TypeScript can catch errors even if you don’t provide type annotations, it’s able

to do a much more thorough job if you do. This is because type annotations tell Type‐

Script what your intent is, and this lets it spot places where your code’s behavior does

not match your intent. For example, what if you’d reversed the capital/capitol

spelling mistake in the previous example?

```
const states = [
{name: 'Alabama', capitol: 'Montgomery'},
{name: 'Alaska', capitol: 'Juneau'},
{name: 'Arizona', capitol: 'Phoenix'},
// ...
];
for ( const state of states) {
console.log(state.capital);
// ~~~~~~~ Property 'capital' does not exist on type
// '{ name: string; capitol: string; }'.
// Did you mean 'capitol'?
}
```
**4 | Chapter 1: Getting to Know TypeScript**


The error that was so helpful before now gets it exactly wrong! The problem is that

you’ve spelled the same property two different ways, and TypeScript doesn’t know

which one is right. It can guess, but it may not always be correct. The solution is to

clarify your intent by explicitly declaring the type of states:

```
interface State {
name: string ;
capital: string ;
}
const states: State[] = [
{name: 'Alabama', capitol: 'Montgomery'},
// ~~~~~~~
{name: 'Alaska', capitol: 'Juneau'},
// ~~~~~~~
{name: 'Arizona', capitol: 'Phoenix'},
// ~~~~~~~ Object literal may only specify known properties,
// but 'capitol' does not exist in type 'State'.
// Did you mean to write 'capital'?
// ...
];
for ( const state of states) {
console.log(state.capital);
}
```
Now the errors match the problem and the suggested fix is correct. By spelling out

your intent, you’ve also helped TypeScript spot other potential problems. For

instance, had you only misspelled capitol once in the array, there wouldn’t have

been an error before. But with the type annotation, there is:

```
const states: State[] = [
{name: 'Alabama', capital: 'Montgomery'},
{name: 'Alaska', capitol: 'Juneau'},
// ~~~~~~~ Did you mean to write 'capital'?
{name: 'Arizona', capital: 'Phoenix'},
// ...
];
```
This will become a familiar dynamic as you work with the type checker: the more

information you give it, the more problems it will be able to find.

In terms of the Venn diagram, we can add in a new group of programs: TypeScript

programs which pass the type checker (see Figure 1-2).

```
Item 1: Understand the Relationship Between TypeScript and JavaScript | 5
```

Figure 1-2. All JavaScript programs are TypeScript programs. But only some JavaScript

(and TypeScript) programs pass the type checker.

If the statement that “TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript” feels wrong to you, it may

be because you’re thinking of this third set of programs in the diagram. In practice,

this is the most relevant one to the day-to-day experience of using TypeScript. Gener‐

ally when you use TypeScript, you try to keep your code passing all the type checks.

TypeScript’s type system models the runtime behavior of JavaScript. This may result in

some surprises if you’re coming from a language with stricter runtime checks. For

example:

```
const x = 2 + '3'; // OK
// ^? const x: string
const y = '2' + 3; // OK
// ^? const y: string
```
These statements both pass the type checker, even though they are questionable and

do produce runtime errors in many other languages. But this does accurately model

the runtime behavior of JavaScript, where both expressions result in the string "23".

TypeScript does draw the line somewhere, though. The type checker flags issues in all

of these statements, even though they do not throw exceptions at runtime:

```
const a = null + 7; // Evaluates to 7 in JS
// ~~~~ The value 'null' cannot be used here.
const b = [] + 12; // Evaluates to '12' in JS
// ~~~~~~~ Operator '+' cannot be applied to types ...
alert('Hello', 'TypeScript'); // alerts "Hello"
// ~~~~~~~~~~~~ Expected 0-1 arguments, but got 2
```
The guiding principle of TypeScript’s type system is that it should model JavaScript’s

runtime behavior. But in all of these cases, TypeScript considers it more likely that the

odd usage is the result of an error than the developer’s intent, so it goes beyond sim‐

ply modeling the runtime behavior. We saw another example of this in the capital/

capitol example, where the program didn’t throw (it logged undefined) but the type

checker still flagged an error.

**6 | Chapter 1: Getting to Know TypeScript**


How does TypeScript decide when to model JavaScript’s runtime behavior and when

to go beyond it? Ultimately this is a matter of taste. By adopting TypeScript you’re

trusting the judgment of the team that builds it. If you enjoy adding null and 7 or []

and 12 , or calling functions with superfluous arguments, then TypeScript might not

be for you!

If your program type checks, could it still throw an error at runtime? The answer is

“yes.” Here’s an example:

```
const names = ['Alice', 'Bob'];
console.log(names[2].toUpperCase());
```
When you run this, it throws:

```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toUpperCase')
```
TypeScript assumed the array access would be within bounds, but it was not. The

result was an exception.

Uncaught errors also frequently come up when you use the any type, which we’ll dis‐

cuss in Item 5 and in more detail in Chapter 5.

The root cause of these exceptions is that TypeScript’s understanding of a value’s type

(its static type) and its actual type at runtime have diverged. A type system that can

guarantee the accuracy of its static types is said to be sound. TypeScript’s type system

is very much not sound, nor was it ever intended to be. Item 48 explores more ways

that unsoundness can arise.

If soundness is important to you, you may want to look at other languages like Rea‐

son, PureScript, or Dart. While these do offer more guarantees of runtime safety, this

comes at a cost: it takes more work to convince their type checkers that your code is

correct, and none of these are a superset of JavaScript, so migration will be more

complicated.

**Things to Remember**

- TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript: all JavaScript programs are syntactically
    valid TypeScript programs, but not all TypeScript programs are valid JavaScript
    programs.
- TypeScript adds a static type system that models JavaScript’s runtime behavior
    and tries to spot code that will throw exceptions at runtime.
- It is possible for code to pass the type checker but still throw at runtime.
- TypeScript disallows some legal but questionable JavaScript constructs such as
    calling functions with the wrong number of arguments.
- Type annotations tell TypeScript your intent and help it distinguish correct and
    incorrect code.

```

### Item 2: Know Which TypeScript Options You’re Using

Does this code pass the type checker?

```
function add(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
add(10, null );
```
Without knowing which options you’re using, it’s impossible to say! The TypeScript

compiler has an enormous set of these, over a hundred at the time of this writing.

They can be set via the command line:

```
$ tsc --noImplicitAny program.ts
```
or via a configuration file, tsconfig.json:

```
{
"compilerOptions" : {
"noImplicitAny" : true
}
}
```
You should prefer the configuration file. It ensures that your coworkers and tools all

know exactly how you plan to use TypeScript. You can create one by running tsc

--init.

Many of TypeScript’s configuration settings control where it looks for source files and

what sort of output it generates. But a few control core aspects of the language itself.

These are high-level design choices that most languages do not leave to their users.

TypeScript can feel like a very different language depending on how it is configured.

To use it effectively, you should understand the most important of these settings:

noImplicitAny and strictNullChecks.

**noImplicitAny**

noImplicitAny controls what TypeScript does when it can’t determine the type of a

variable. This code is valid when noImplicitAny is off:

```
function add(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```
If you mouse over the add symbol in your editor, it will reveal what TypeScript has

inferred about the type of that function:

```
function add(a: any , b: any ): any
```
**8 | Chapter 1: Getting to Know TypeScript**


The any types effectively disable the type checker for code involving these parame‐

ters. any is a useful tool, but it should be used with caution. For much more on any,

see Item 5 and Chapter 5.

These are called implicit _any_ s because you never wrote the word “any” but still wound

up with dangerous any types. This becomes an error if you set the noImplicitAny

option:

```
function add(a, b) {
// ~ Parameter 'a' implicitly has an 'any' type
// ~ Parameter 'b' implicitly has an 'any' type
return a + b;
}
```
These errors can be fixed by explicitly writing type declarations, either : any or a

more specific type:

```
function add(a: number , b: number ) {
return a + b;
}
```
TypeScript is the most helpful when it has type information, so you should be sure to

set noImplicitAny whenever possible. Once you grow accustomed to all variables

having types, TypeScript without noImplicitAny feels almost like a different

language.

For new projects, you should start with noImplicitAny on, so that you write the types

as you write your code. This will help TypeScript spot problems, improve the read‐

ability of your code, and enhance your development experience (see Item 6).

Leaving noImplicitAny off is only appropriate if you’re transitioning a project

from JavaScript to TypeScript (see Chapter 10). Even then, this should only be a tem‐

porary state and you should turn it on as soon as possible. TypeScript without

noImplicitAny is surprisingly loose. Item 83 explores how this can lead to trouble.

**strictNullChecks**

strictNullChecks controls whether null and undefined are permissible values in

every type.

This code is valid when strictNullChecks is off:

```
const x: number = null ; // OK, null is a valid number
```
but triggers an error when you turn strictNullChecks on:

```
const x: number = null ;
// ~ Type 'null' is not assignable to type 'number'
```
A similar error would have occurred had you used undefined instead of null.

```
Item 2: Know Which TypeScript Options You’re Using | 9
```

If you mean to allow null, you can fix the error by making your intent explicit:

```
const x: number | null = null ;
```
If you do not wish to permit null, you’ll need to track down where it came from and

add either a check or an assertion:

```
const statusEl = document.getElementById('status');
statusEl.textContent = 'Ready';
// ~~~~~ 'statusEl' is possibly 'null'.
```
```
if (statusEl) {
statusEl.textContent = 'Ready'; // OK, null has been excluded
}
statusEl!.textContent = 'Ready'; // OK, we've asserted that el is non-null
```
Using an if statement in this way is known as “narrowing” or “refining” a type, and

this pattern is explored in Item 22. The “!” on the last line is called a “non-null asser‐

tion.” Type assertions have their place in TypeScript, but they can also lead to runtime

exceptions. Item 9 will explain when you should and should not use a type assertion.

strictNullChecks is tremendously helpful for catching errors involving null and

undefined values, but it does increase the difficulty of using the language. If you’re

starting a new project and you’ve used TypeScript before, set strictNullChecks.

But if you’re new to the language or migrating a JavaScript codebase, you may

elect to leave it off. You should certainly set noImplicitAny before you set

strictNullChecks.

If you choose to work without strictNullChecks, keep an eye out for the dreaded

“undefined is not an object” runtime error. Every one of these is a reminder that you

should consider enabling stricter checking. Changing this setting will only get harder

as your project grows, so try not to wait too long before enabling it. Most TypeScript

code uses strictNullChecks, and this is eventually where you want to be.

**Other Options**

There are many other settings that affect language semantics (e.g., noImplicitThis

and strictFunctionTypes), but these are minor compared to noImplicitAny and

strictNullChecks. To enable all of these checks, turn on the strict setting. Type‐

Script is able to catch the most errors with strict, so this should be your goal.

If you create a project using tsc --init, you’ll be in strict mode by default.

There are also a few “stricter than strict” options available. You can opt into these to

make TypeScript even more aggressive about finding errors in your code. One of

these options is noUncheckedIndexedAccess, which helps to catch errors around

object and array access. For example, this code has no type errors under --strict but

throws an exception at runtime:

**10 | Chapter 1: Getting to Know TypeScript**


```
const tenses = ['past', 'present', 'future'];
tenses[3].toUpperCase();
```
With noUncheckedIndexedAccess set, this is an error:

```
const tenses = ['past', 'present', 'future'];
tenses[3].toUpperCase();
// ~~~~~~ Object is possibly 'undefined'.
```
This is not a free lunch, however. Many valid accesses will also be flagged as possibly

undefined:

```
tenses[0].toUpperCase();
// ~~~~~~ Object is possibly 'undefined'.
```
Some TypeScript projects use this setting, while others don’t. You should at least be

aware that it exists. There will be more to say about this setting in Item 48.

Know which options you’re using! If a coworker shares a TypeScript example and

you’re unable to reproduce their errors, make sure your compiler options are the

same.

**Things to Remember**

- The TypeScript compiler includes several settings that affect core aspects of the
    language.
- Configure TypeScript using tsconfig.json rather than command-line options.
- Turn on noImplicitAny unless you are transitioning a JavaScript project to
    TypeScript.
- Use strictNullChecks to prevent “undefined is not an object”-style runtime
    errors.
- Aim to enable strict to get the most thorough checking that TypeScript can
    offer.

### Item 3: Understand That Code Generation Is Independent of Types

At a high level, tsc (the TypeScript compiler) does two things:

- It converts next-generation TypeScript/JavaScript to an older version of Java‐
    Script that works in browsers or other runtimes (“transpiling”).
- It checks your code for type errors.

What’s surprising is that these two behaviors are entirely independent of one another.

Put another way, the types in your code cannot affect the JavaScript that TypeScript

```
Item 3: Understand That Code Generation Is Independent of Types | 11
```

```
2 The best way to build an intuition for this is by using the TypeScript playground, which shows your Type‐
Script and the resulting JavaScript side by side.
```
emits. Since it’s this JavaScript that gets executed, this means that your types can’t

affect the way your code runs.

This has some surprising implications and should inform your expectations about

what TypeScript can and cannot do for you.

**You Cannot Check TypeScript Types at Runtime**

You may be tempted to write code like this:

```
interface Square {
width: number ;
}
interface Rectangle extends Square {
height: number ;
}
type Shape = Square | Rectangle;
```
```
function calculateArea(shape: Shape) {
if (shape instanceof Rectangle) {
// ~~~~~~~~~ 'Rectangle' only refers to a type,
// but is being used as a value here
return shape.height * shape.width;
// ~~~~~~ Property 'height' does not exist on type 'Shape'
} else {
return shape.width * shape.width;
}
}
```
The instanceof check happens at runtime, but Rectangle is a type and so it cannot

affect the runtime behavior of the code. TypeScript types are “erasable”: part of com‐

pilation to JavaScript is simply removing all the interfaces, types, and type annota‐

tions from your code. This is easiest to see if you look at the JavaScript that this

sample compiles down to:

```
function calculateArea(shape) {
if (shape instanceof Rectangle) {
return shape.height * shape.width;
} else {
return shape.width * shape.width;
}
}
```
There’s no mention of Rectangle before the instanceof check here, hence the prob‐

lem.^2 To ascertain the type of shape you’re dealing with, you’ll need some way to

**12 | Chapter 1: Getting to Know TypeScript**


reconstruct its type at runtime, i.e., some way that makes sense in the generated Java‐

Script, not just in the original TypeScript.

There are several ways to do this. One is to check for the presence of a height

property:

```
function calculateArea(shape: Shape) {
if ('height' in shape) {
return shape.width * shape.height;
// ^? (parameter) shape: Rectangle
} else {
return shape.width * shape.width;
}
}
```
This works because the property check only involves values available at runtime, but

still allows the type checker to refine shape’s type to Rectangle.

Another way would be to introduce a “tag” to explicitly store the type in a way that’s

available at runtime:

```
interface Square {
kind: 'square';
width: number ;
}
interface Rectangle {
kind: 'rectangle';
height: number ;
width: number ;
}
type Shape = Square | Rectangle;
```
```
function calculateArea(shape: Shape) {
if (shape.kind === 'rectangle') {
return shape.width * shape.height;
// ^? (parameter) shape: Rectangle
} else {
return shape.width * shape.width;
// ^? (parameter) shape: Square
}
}
```
Here the kind property acts as the “tag,” and we say that the Shape type is a “tagged

union.” It’s also sometimes called a “discriminated union,” in which case kind is the

“discriminant.” The terms are interchangeable. Because they make it so easy to

recover type information at runtime, tagged/discriminated unions are ubiquitous in

TypeScript.

Some constructs introduce both a type (which is not available at runtime) and a value

(which is). The class keyword is one of these. Making Square and Rectangle classes

would be another way to fix the error:

```
Item 3: Understand That Code Generation Is Independent of Types | 13
```

```
class Square {
width: number ;
constructor (width: number ) {
this .width = width;
}
}
class Rectangle extends Square {
height: number ;
constructor (width: number , height: number ) {
super (width);
this .height = height;
}
}
type Shape = Square | Rectangle;
```
```
function calculateArea(shape: Shape) {
if (shape instanceof Rectangle) {
return shape.width * shape.height;
// ^? (parameter) shape: Rectangle
} else {
return shape.width * shape.width;
// ^? (parameter) shape: Square
}
}
```
This works because class Rectangle introduces both a type and a value, whereas

interface only introduced a type.

The Rectangle in type Shape = Square | Rectangle refers to the type, but the

Rectangle in shape instanceof Rectangle refers to the value, in this case the con‐

structor function. This distinction is important to understand but can be quite subtle.

Item 8 shows you how to tell which is which.

**Code with Type Errors Can Produce Output**

Because code output is independent of type checking, it follows that code with type

errors can produce output!

```
$ cat test.ts
let x = 'hello';
x = 1234;
$ tsc test.ts
test.ts:2:1 - error TS2322: Type '1234' is not assignable to type 'string'
```
```
2 x = 1234;
~
```
```
$ cat test.js
var x = 'hello';
x = 1234;
```
**14 | Chapter 1: Getting to Know TypeScript**


This can be quite surprising if you’re coming from a language like C or Java where

type checking and output go hand in hand. You can think of all TypeScript errors as

being similar to warnings in those languages: it’s likely that they indicate a problem

and are worth investigating, but they won’t stop the build.

**Compiling and Type Checking**

```
This is likely the source of some sloppy language that is common around TypeScript.
You’ll often hear people say that their TypeScript “doesn’t compile” as a way of saying
that it has errors. But this isn’t technically correct! Only the code generation is
“compiling.” So long as your TypeScript is valid JavaScript (and often even if it isn’t),
the TypeScript compiler will produce output. At the risk of sounding pedantic, it’s
better to say that your code has errors, or that it “doesn’t type check.”
```
Code emission in the presence of errors is helpful in practice. If you’re building a web

application, you may know that there are problems with a particular part of it. But

because TypeScript will still generate code in the presence of errors, you can test the

other parts of your application before you fix them.

You should aim for zero errors when you commit code, lest you fall into the trap of

having to remember what is an expected or unexpected error. If you want to disable

output on errors, you can use the noEmitOnError option in tsconfig.json, or the equiv‐

alent in your build tool.

**Type Operations Cannot Affect Runtime Values**

Suppose you have a value that could be a string or a number and you’d like to normal‐

ize it so that it’s always a number. Here’s a misguided attempt that the type checker

accepts:

```
function asNumber(val: number | string ): number {
return val as number ;
}
```
Looking at the generated JavaScript makes it clear what this function really does:

```
function asNumber(val) {
return val;
}
```
There is no conversion going on whatsoever. The as number is a type operation, so it

cannot affect the runtime behavior of your code. To normalize the value you’ll need

to check its runtime type and do the conversion using JavaScript constructs:

```
function asNumber(val: number | string ): number {
return Number(val);
}
```
```
Item 3: Understand That Code Generation Is Independent of Types | 15
```

“as number” is a type assertion, sometimes inaccurately called a “cast.” For more on

when it’s appropriate to use type assertions, see Item 9.

**Runtime Types May Not Be the Same as Declared Types**

Could this function ever hit the final console.log?

```
function setLightSwitch(value: boolean ) {
switch (value) {
case true :
turnLightOn();
break ;
case false :
turnLightOff();
break ;
default :
console.log(`I'm afraid I can't do that.`);
}
}
```
TypeScript usually flags dead code, but it does not complain about this, even with the

strict option. How could you hit this branch?

The key is to remember that boolean is the declared type. Because it is a TypeScript

type, it goes away at runtime. In JavaScript code, a user might inadvertently call

setLightSwitch with a value like "ON".

There are ways to trigger this code path in pure TypeScript, too. Perhaps the function

is called with a value that comes from a network call:

```
interface LightApiResponse {
lightSwitchValue: boolean ;
}
async function setLight() {
const response = await fetch('/light');
const result: LightApiResponse = await response.json();
setLightSwitch(result.lightSwitchValue);
}
```
You’ve declared that the result of the /light request is LightApiResponse, but noth‐

ing enforces this. If you misunderstood the API and lightSwitchValue is really a

string, then a string will be passed to setLightSwitch at runtime. Or perhaps the

API changed after you deployed.

TypeScript can get quite confusing when your runtime types don’t match the declared

types, and you should avoid these so-called “unsound” types whenever you can. But

be aware that it’s possible for a value to have a runtime type other than the one you’ve

declared. For more on soundness, see Item 48.

**16 | Chapter 1: Getting to Know TypeScript**


**You Cannot Overload a Function Based on TypeScript Types**

Languages like C++ allow you to define multiple versions of a function that differ

only in the types of their parameters. This is called “function overloading.” Because

the runtime behavior of your code is independent of its TypeScript types, this con‐

struct isn’t possible in TypeScript:

```
function add(a: number , b: number ) { return a + b; }
// ~~~ Duplicate function implementation
function add(a: string , b: string ) { return a + b; }
// ~~~ Duplicate function implementation
```
TypeScript does provide a facility for overloading functions, but it operates entirely at

the type level. You can provide multiple type signatures for a function, but only a sin‐

gle implementation:

```
function add(a: number , b: number ): number ;
function add(a: string , b: string ): string ;
```
```
function add(a: any , b: any ) {
return a + b;
}
```
```
const three = add(1, 2);
// ^? const three: number
const twelve = add('1', '2');
// ^? const twelve: string
```
The first two signatures of add only provide type information. When TypeScript pro‐

duces JavaScript output, they are removed, and only the implementation remains.

The any parameters in the implementation aren’t great. We’ll explore how to handle

those in Item 52, which also covers some subtleties to be aware of with TypeScript

function overloads.

**TypeScript Types Have No Effect on Runtime Performance**

Because types and type operations are erased when you generate JavaScript, they can‐

not have an effect on runtime performance. TypeScript’s static types are truly zero

cost. The next time someone offers runtime overhead as a reason to not use Type‐

Script, you’ll know exactly how well they’ve tested this claim!

There are two caveats to this:

- While there is no runtime overhead, the TypeScript compiler will introduce build
    time overhead. The TypeScript team takes compiler performance seriously and
    compilation is usually quite fast, especially for incremental builds. If the overhead
    becomes significant, your build tool may have a “transpile only” option to skip
    the type checking. There will be more to say about compiler performance in
    Item 78.

```
Item 3: Understand That Code Generation Is Independent of Types | 17
```

- The code that TypeScript emits to support older runtimes may incur a perfor‐
    mance overhead versus native implementations. For example, if you use genera‐
    tor functions and target ES5, which predates generators, then tsc will emit some
    helper code to make things work. This will incur some overhead versus a native
    implementation of generators. This is the case for any JavaScript “transpiler,” not
    just TypeScript. Regardless, this has to do with the emit target and language levels
    and is still independent of the types.

**Things to Remember**

- Code generation is independent of the type system. This means that TypeScript
    types cannot affect the runtime behavior of your code.
- It is possible for a program with type errors to produce code (“compile”).
- TypeScript types are not available at runtime. To query a type at runtime, you
    need some way to reconstruct it. Tagged unions and property checking are com‐
    mon ways to do this.
- Some constructs, such as class, introduce both a TypeScript type and a value
    that is available at runtime.
- Because they are erased as part of compilation, TypeScript types cannot affect the
    runtime performance of your code.

### Item 4: Get Comfortable with Structural Typing

JavaScript encourages “duck typing”: if you pass a function a value with all the right

properties, it won’t care how you made the value. It will just use it. (This term refers

to the saying, “If it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, then it probably is a duck.”)

TypeScript models this behavior using what’s known as a structural type system. This

can sometimes lead to surprising results because the type checker’s understanding of

a type may be broader than what you had in mind. Having a good grasp of structural

typing will help you make sense of errors and non-errors and help you write more

robust code.

Say you’re working on a physics library and have a 2D vector type:

```
interface Vector2D {
x: number ;
y: number ;
}
```
You write a function to calculate its length:

```
function calculateLength(v: Vector2D) {
return Math.sqrt(v.x ** 2 + v.y ** 2);
}
```
**18 | Chapter 1: Getting to Know TypeScript**


Now you introduce the notion of a named vector:

```
interface NamedVector {
name: string ;
x: number ;
y: number ;
}
```
The calculateLength function will work with NamedVectors because they have x and

y properties that are numbers. TypeScript is smart enough to figure this out:

```
const v: NamedVector = { x: 3, y: 4, name: 'Pythagoras' };
calculateLength(v); // OK, result is 5
```
What’s interesting is that you never declared the relationship between Vector2D and

NamedVector. And you didn’t have to write an alternative implementation of

calculateLength for NamedVectors. TypeScript’s type system is modeling JavaScript’s

runtime behavior (Item 1). It allowed calculateLength to be called with a

NamedVector because its structure was compatible with Vector2D. This is where the

term “structural typing” comes from.

But this can also lead to trouble. Say you add a 3D vector type:

```
interface Vector3D {
x: number ;
y: number ;
z: number ;
}
```
and write a function to normalize them (make their length 1):

```
function normalize(v: Vector3D) {
const length = calculateLength(v);
return {
x: v.x / length,
y: v.y / length,
z: v.z / length,
};
}
```
If you call this function, you’re likely to get a vector with a length greater than 1:

```
> normalize({x: 3, y: 4, z: 5})
{ x: 0.6, y: 0.8, z: 1 }
```
This vector has a length of around 1.4, not 1. So what went wrong, and why didn’t

TypeScript catch the error?

The bug is that calculateLength operates on 2D vectors, but normalize operates on

3D vectors. So the z component is ignored in the normalization.

```
Item 4: Get Comfortable with Structural Typing | 19
```

What’s perhaps more surprising is that the type checker does not catch this issue.

Why are you allowed to call calculateLength with a 3D vector, despite its type decla‐

ration saying that it takes 2D vectors?

What worked so well with named vectors has backfired here. Calling calculate

Length with an {x, y, z} object doesn’t throw an error. So the type checker doesn’t

complain either, and this behavior has led to a bug.

(If you want this to be an error, you have some options. Item 63 presents a trick to

specifically prohibit the z property, and Item 64 shows how you can use “brands” to

prevent this sort of structural typing altogether.)

As you write functions, it’s easy to imagine that they will be called with arguments

having the properties you’ve declared and no others. This is known as a “closed,”

“sealed,” or “precise” type, and it cannot be expressed in TypeScript’s type system. Like

it or not, your types are “open.”

This can sometimes lead to surprises:

```
function calculateLengthL1(v: Vector3D) {
let length = 0;
for ( const axis of Object.keys(v)) {
const coord = v[axis];
// ~~~~~~~ Element implicitly has an 'any' type because ...
// 'string' can't be used to index type 'Vector3D'
length += Math.abs(coord);
}
return length;
}
```
Why is this an error? Since axis is one of the keys of v, which is a Vector3D, it should

be either "x", "y", or "z". And according to the declaration of Vector3D, these are all

numbers, so shouldn’t the type of coord be number?

Is this error a false positive? No! TypeScript is correct to complain. The logic in the

previous paragraph assumes that Vector3D is sealed and does not have other proper‐

ties. But it could:

```
const vec3D = {x: 3, y: 4, z: 1, address: '123 Broadway'};
calculateLengthL1(vec3D); // OK, returns NaN
```
Since v could conceivably have any properties, the type of axis is string. TypeScript

has no reason to believe that v[axis] is a number because, as you just saw, it might

not be. (The vec3D variable here avoids excess property checking, which is the subject

of Item 11.)

Iterating over objects can be tricky to type correctly. We’ll return to this topic in Item

60 , but in this case an implementation without loops would be better:

**20 | Chapter 1: Getting to Know TypeScript**


```
function calculateLengthL1(v: Vector3D) {
return Math.abs(v.x) + Math.abs(v.y) + Math.abs(v.z);
}
```
Structural typing can also lead to surprises with classes, which are compared struc‐

turally for assignability:

```
class SmallNumContainer {
num: number ;
constructor (num: number ) {
if (num < 0 || num >= 10) {
throw new Error(`You gave me ${num} but I want something 0-9.`)
}
this .num = num;
}
}
```
```
const a = new SmallNumContainer(5);
const b: SmallNumContainer = { num: 2024 }; // OK!
```
Why is b assignable to SmallNumContainer? It has a num property that’s a number. So

the structures match. This might lead to trouble if you write a function that assumes

the validation logic in SmallNumContainer’s constructor has run. This is less likely to

happen by chance for classes with more properties and methods, but it is quite differ‐

ent than languages like C++ or Java, where declaring a parameter of type SmallNum

Container guarantees that it will be either SmallNumContainer or a subclass of it, and

hence that the validation logic in the constructor will have run.

Structural typing is beneficial when you’re writing tests. Say you have a function that

runs a query on a database and processes the results:

```
interface Author {
first: string ;
last: string ;
}
function getAuthors(database: PostgresDB): Author[] {
const authorRows = database.runQuery(`SELECT first, last FROM authors`);
return authorRows.map(row => ({first: row[0], last: row[1]}));
}
```
To test this, you could create a mock PostgresDB. But a simpler approach is to use

structural typing and define a narrower interface:

```
interface DB {
runQuery: (sql: string ) => any [];
}
function getAuthors(database: DB): Author[] {
const authorRows = database.runQuery(`SELECT first, last FROM authors`);
return authorRows.map(row => ({first: row[0], last: row[1]}));
}
```
```
Item 4: Get Comfortable with Structural Typing | 21
```

You can still pass getAuthors a PostgresDB in production since it has a runQuery

method. Because of structural typing, the PostgresDB doesn’t need to say that it

implements DB. TypeScript will figure out that it does.

When you write your tests, you can pass in a simpler object instead:

```
test('getAuthors', () => {
const authors = getAuthors({
runQuery(sql: string ) {
return [['Toni', 'Morrison'], ['Maya', 'Angelou']];
}
});
expect(authors).toEqual([
{first: 'Toni', last: 'Morrison'},
{first: 'Maya', last: 'Angelou'}
]);
});
```
TypeScript will verify that our test DB conforms to the interface. And your tests don’t

need to know anything about your production database: no mocking libraries neces‐

sary! By introducing an abstraction (DB), we’ve freed our logic (and tests) from the

details of a specific implementation (PostgresDB).

Another advantage of structural typing is that it can cleanly sever dependencies

between libraries. For more on this, see Item 70.

**Things to Remember**

- Understand that JavaScript is duck typed and TypeScript uses structural typing to
    model this: values assignable to your interfaces might have properties beyond
    those explicitly listed in your type declarations. Types are not “sealed.”
- Be aware that classes also follow structural typing rules. You may not have an
    instance of the class you expect!
- Use structural typing to facilitate unit testing.

### Item 5: Limit Use of the any Type

TypeScript’s type system is gradual and optional: gradual because you can add types to

your code bit by bit (with noImplicitAny), and optional because you can disable the

type checker whenever you like. The key to these features is the any type:

```
let ageInYears: number ;
ageInYears = '12';
// ~~~~~~~ Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.
ageInYears = '12' as any ; // OK
```
**22 | Chapter 1: Getting to Know TypeScript**


The type checker is right to complain here, but you can silence it by typing as any.

As you start using TypeScript, it’s tempting to use any types and type assertions (as

any) when you don’t understand an error, think the type checker is incorrect, or just

don’t want to take the time to write out type declarations.

In some cases this may be OK, but be aware that using any eliminates many of the

advantages of using TypeScript. You should at least understand its dangers before you

use it.

**There’s No Type Safety with any Types**

In the preceding example, the type declaration says that ageInYears is a number. But

any lets you assign a string to it. The type checker will believe that it’s a number

(that’s what you said, after all), and the chaos will go uncaught:

```
ageInYears += 1; // OK; at runtime, ageInYears is now "121"
```
**any Lets You Break Contracts**

When you write a function, you are specifying a contract: if the caller gives you a cer‐

tain type of input, you’ll produce a certain type of output. But with an any type, you

can break these contracts:

```
function calculateAge(birthDate: Date): number {
// ...
}
```
```
let birthDate: any = '1990-01-19';
calculateAge(birthDate); // OK
```
The birth date parameter should be a Date, not a string. The any type has let you

break the contract of calculateAge. This can be particularly problematic because

JavaScript is often willing to implicitly convert between types. A string will some‐

times work where a number is expected, only to break in other circumstances.

**There Are No Language Services for any Types**

When a variable has a non-any type, the TypeScript language services are able

to provide intelligent autocomplete and contextual documentation (as shown in

Figure 1-3).

```
Item 5: Limit Use of the any Type | 23
```

Figure 1-3. The TypeScript Language Service is able to provide contextual autocomplete

for symbols with types.

But for symbols with an any type, you’re on your own (Figure 1-4).

Figure 1-4. There is no autocomplete for properties on symbols with _any_ types.

Renaming is another such service. If you have a Person type and functions to format

a person’s name:

```
interface Person {
first: string ;
last: string ;
}
```
```
const formatName = (p: Person ) => `${p.first} ${p.last}`;
const formatNameAny = (p: any ) => `${p.first} ${p.last}`;
```
then you can select first in your editor, choose “Rename Symbol,” and change it to

firstName (see Figures 1-5 and 1-6).

Figure 1-5. Renaming a symbol in VS Code.

Figure 1-6. Choosing the new name.

**24 | Chapter 1: Getting to Know TypeScript**


This changes the formatName function but not the any version:

```
interface Person {
firstName: string ;
last: string ;
}
const formatName = (p: Person ) => `${p.firstName} ${p.last}`;
const formatNameAny = (p: any ) => `${p.first} ${p.last}`;
```
One of TypeScript’s tag lines is “JavaScript that scales.” A key part of “scales” is the

language services, which are an essential part of the TypeScript experience (see Item

6). Losing them will lead to a loss in productivity, not just for you but for everyone

else working with your code.

**any Types Mask Bugs When You Refactor Code**

Suppose you’re building a web application in which users can select some sort of

item. One of your components might have an onSelectItem callback. Writing a type

for an item seems like a hassle, so you just use any as a stand-in:

```
interface ComponentProps {
onSelectItem: (item: any ) => void ;
}
```
Here’s code that manages that component:

```
function renderSelector(props: ComponentProps) { /* ... */ }
```
```
let selectedId: number = 0;
function handleSelectItem(item: any ) {
selectedId = item.id;
}
```
```
renderSelector({onSelectItem: handleSelectItem});
```
Later you rework the selector in a way that makes it harder to pass the whole item

object through to onSelectItem. But that’s no big deal since you just need the ID. You

change the signature in ComponentProps:

```
interface ComponentProps {
onSelectItem: (id: number ) => void ;
}
```
You update the component and everything passes the type checker. Victory!

... or is it? handleSelectItem takes an any parameter, so it’s just as happy with an

item as it is with an ID. It produces a runtime exception, despite passing the type

checker. Had you used a more specific type, this would have been caught by the type

checker.

```
Item 5: Limit Use of the any Type | 25
```

**any Hides Your Type Design**

The type definition for complex objects, like your application state, can get quite

long. Rather than writing out types for the dozens of properties in your app’s state,

you may be tempted to just use an any type and be done with it.

This is problematic for all the reasons listed in this item. But it’s also problematic

because it hides the design of your state. As Chapter 4 explains, good type design is

essential for writing clean, correct, and understandable code. With an any type, your

type design is implicit. This makes it hard to know whether the design is a good one,

or even what the design is at all. If you ask a coworker to review a change, they’ll have

to reconstruct whether and how you changed the application state. Better to write it

out for everyone to see.

**any Undermines Confidence in the Type System**

Every time you make a mistake and the type checker catches it, it boosts your confi‐

dence in the type system. But when you see a type error at runtime that TypeScript

didn’t catch, that confidence takes a hit. If you’re introducing TypeScript on a larger

team, this might make your coworkers question whether TypeScript is worth the

effort. any types are often the source of these uncaught errors.

TypeScript aims to make your life easier, but TypeScript with lots of any types can be

harder to work with than untyped JavaScript because you have to fix type errors and

still keep track of the real types in your head. When your types match reality, it frees

you from the burden of having to keep type information in your head. TypeScript will

keep track of it for you.

For the times when you must use any, there are better and worse ways to do it. For

much more on how to limit the downsides of any, see Chapter 5.

**Things to Remember**

- TypeScript’s any type allows you to disable most forms of type checking for a
    symbol.
- The any type eliminates type safety, lets you break contracts, harms developer
    experience, makes refactoring error prone, hides your type design, and under‐
    mines confidence in the type system.
- Avoid using any when you can!

**26 | Chapter 1: Getting to Know TypeScript**


**CHAPTER 2**

### TypeScript’s Type System

TypeScript can generate JavaScript (Item 3), but the type system is the main event.

This is why you’re using the language!

This chapter walks you through the nuts and bolts of TypeScript’s type system: how to

think about it, how to use it, choices you’ll need to make, and features you should

avoid. TypeScript’s type system is surprisingly powerful and able to express things

you might not expect a type system to be able to. The items in this chapter will give

you a solid foundation to build upon as you write TypeScript and read the rest of this

book.

### Item 6: Use Your Editor to Interrogate and Explore the Type System

When you install TypeScript, you get two executables:

- tsc, the TypeScript compiler
- tsserver, the TypeScript standalone server

You’re much more likely to run the TypeScript compiler directly, but the server is

every bit as important because it provides language services. These include autocom‐

plete, inspection, navigation, and refactoring. You typically use these services through

your editor. If yours isn’t configured to provide them, then you’re missing out! Serv‐

ices like autocomplete are one of the things that make TypeScript such a joy to use.

But beyond convenience, your editor is the best place to build and test your knowl‐

edge of the type system. This will help you build an intuition for when TypeScript is

able to infer types, which is key to writing compact, idiomatic code (see Item 18).

##### 27


The details will vary from editor to editor, but you can generally hover over a symbol

to see what TypeScript considers its type (see Figure 2-1).

Figure 2-1. An editor (VS Code) showing that the inferred type of the _num_ symbol is

_number_.

You didn’t write number here, but TypeScript was able to figure it out based on the

value 10.

You can also inspect functions, as shown in Figure 2-2.

Figure 2-2. Using an editor to reveal the inferred return type for a function.

The noteworthy bit of information is the inferred value for the return type, number. If

this does not match your expectation, you should add a type declaration and track

down the discrepancy (see Item 9).

Seeing what TypeScript thinks a variable’s type is at any given point is essential for

building an intuition around widening (Item 20) and narrowing (Item 22). Watching

the type of a variable change in the branch of a conditional is a tremendous way to

build confidence in the type system (see Figure 2-3).

Figure 2-3. The type of message is _string | null_ outside the branch, but _string_

inside.

You can inspect individual properties in a larger object to see what TypeScript has

inferred about them (see Figure 2-4).

**28 | Chapter 2: TypeScript’s Type System**


Figure 2-4. Inspecting how TypeScript has inferred types in an object.

If your intention was for x to be a tuple type ([number, number]), then a type anno‐

tation will be required.

To see inferred generic types in the middle of a chain of operations, inspect the

method name (as shown in Figure 2-5).

Figure 2-5. Revealing inferred generic types in a chain of method calls.

The Array<string> indicates that TypeScript understands that split produced an

array of strings. While there was little ambiguity in this case, this information can

prove essential in writing and debugging long chains of function calls. TypeScript has

also brought up some helpful documentation for the slice method. Item 68 will

explain how this works.

Seeing type errors in your editor can also be a great way to learn the nuances of the

type system. For example, this function tries to get an HTMLElement by its ID, or

return a default one. TypeScript flags two errors:

```
function getElement(elOrId: string | HTMLElement | null ): HTMLElement {
if ( typeof elOrId === 'object') {
return elOrId;
// ~~~ Type 'HTMLElement | null' is not assignable to type 'HTMLElement'
} else if (elOrId === null ) {
return document.body;
}
elOrId
```
```
Item 6: Use Your Editor to Interrogate and Explore the Type System | 29
```

```
// ^? (parameter) elOrId: string
return document.getElementById(elOrId);
// ~~~ Type 'HTMLElement | null' is not assignable to type 'HTMLElement'
}
```
The intent in the first branch of the if statement was to filter down to just the objects,

namely, the HTMLElements. But oddly enough, in JavaScript typeof null is "object",

so elOrId could still be null in that branch. You can fix this by putting the null

check first. The second error is because document.getElementById can return null,

so you need to handle that case as well, perhaps by throwing an exception:

```
function getElement(elOrId: string |HTMLElement| null ): HTMLElement {
if (elOrId === null ) {
return document.body;
} else if ( typeof elOrId === 'object') {
return elOrId;
// ^? (parameter) elOrId: HTMLElement
}
const el = document.getElementById(elOrId);
// ^? (parameter) elOrId: string
if (!el) {
throw new Error(`No such element ${elOrId}`);
}
return el;
// ^? const el: HTMLElement
}
```
The TypeScript language service also provides refactoring tools. One of the simplest

but most useful of these is renaming a symbol. This is more complicated than find

and replace because the same name might refer to different variables in different

places. In this code, for example, there are three distinct variables all named i:

```
let i = 0;
for ( let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
console.log(i);
{
let i = 12;
console.log(i);
}
}
console.log(i);
```
In VS Code, if you click an i in the for loop and hit F2, a text box will pop up that

lets you put in a new name (Figure 2-6).

**30 | Chapter 2: TypeScript’s Type System**


Figure 2-6. Renaming a symbol in your editor.

When you apply the refactor, only the references to the i that you renamed will

change:

```
let i = 0;
for ( let x = 0; x < 10; x++) {
console.log(x);
{
let i = 12;
console.log(i);
}
}
console.log(i);
```
If you rename a symbol that’s imported from another module, those imports will also

update. There are many other useful refactors available, such as renaming or moving

a file (which updates all imports) and moving a symbol into a new file. You should

familiarize yourself with these because they can significantly increase your productiv‐

ity while working with large TypeScript projects.

Language services can also help you navigate through both your own code as well as

external libraries and type declarations. Suppose you see a call to the global fetch

function in code and want to learn more about it. Your editor should provide a “Go to

Definition” option. In mine it looks like Figure 2-7.

Figure 2-7. The TypeScript language service provides a “Go to Definition” feature that

should be available in your editor.

```
Item 6: Use Your Editor to Interrogate and Explore the Type System | 31
```

Selecting this option takes you into lib.dom.d.ts, the type declarations that TypeScript

includes for the DOM:

```
declare function fetch(
input: RequestInfo | URL, init?: RequestInit
): Promise<Response>;
```
You can see that fetch returns a Promise and takes two arguments. Clicking through

on RequestInfo brings you here:

```
type RequestInfo = Request | string ;
```
from which you can go to Request:

```
interface Request extends Body {
// ...
}
declare var Request: {
prototype: Request;
new (input: RequestInfo | URL, init?: RequestInit | undefined ): Request;
};
```
Here you can see that the Request type and value are being modeled separately (see

Item 8). You’ve seen RequestInfo already. Clicking through on RequestInit shows

all the options you can use in constructing a Request:

```
interface RequestInit {
body?: BodyInit | null ;
cache?: RequestCache;
credentials?: RequestCredentials;
headers?: HeadersInit;
// ...
}
```
There are many more types you could follow here, but you get the idea. Type declara‐

tions can be challenging to read at first, but they’re an excellent way to see what can

be done with TypeScript, how the library you’re using is modeled, and how you might

debug errors. For much more on type declarations, see Chapter 8.

**Things to Remember**

- Take advantage of the TypeScript language services by using an editor that sup‐
    ports them.
- Use your editor to build an intuition for how the type system works and how
    TypeScript infers types.
- Familiarize yourself with TypeScript’s refactoring tools, e.g., renaming symbols
    and files.
- Know how to jump into type declaration files to see how they model behavior.

**32 | Chapter 2: TypeScript’s Type System**


### Item 7: Think of Types as Sets of Values

At runtime, every variable has a single value chosen from JavaScript’s universe of val‐

ues. There are many possible values, including:

- 42
- null
- undefined
- 'Canada'
- {animal: 'Whale', weight_lbs: 40_000}
- /regex/
- new HTMLButtonElement
- (x, y) => x + y

But before your code runs, when TypeScript is checking it for errors, a variable just

has a type. This is best thought of as a set of possible values. This set is known as the

domain of the type. For instance, you can think of the number type as the set of all

number values. 42 and -37.25 are in it, but 'Canada' is not. Depending on strict

NullChecks, null and undefined may or may not be part of the set.

```
You won’t often see the term “domain” in TypeScript documenta‐
tion or literature, or even elsewhere in this book. Types are spoken
of interchangeably with their sets of values. But in this item, it will
be helpful to have a term to refer specifically to the set of values for
a type, as opposed to the type itself.
```
The smallest set is the empty set, which contains no values. It corresponds to the

never type in TypeScript. Because its domain is empty, no values are assignable to a

variable with a never type:

```
const x: never = 12;
// ~ Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'never'.
```
Because it sits at the bottom of the type hierarchy, never is sometimes called a “bot‐

tom type.”

The next smallest sets are those that contain single values. These correspond to literal

types in TypeScript. (In other languages these are sometimes called “unit types.”)

```
type A = 'A';
type B = 'B';
type Twelve = 12;
```
```
Item 7: Think of Types as Sets of Values | 33
```

To form types with two or three values, you can union literal types:

```
type AB = 'A' | 'B';
type AB12 = 'A' | 'B' | 12;
```
The domain of a union type is the union of the domains of its constituent types, as

shown in Figure 2-8. This is what the “union” in “union type” refers to.

Figure 2-8. Values and types as sets of values. The boxes are values ( _"A"_ , _"B"_ , _12_ ) and

the rounded shapes are types ( _A_ , _B_ , _AB_ , _AB12_ , _Twelve_ ), which include a set of values. One

type is assignable to another if it’s entirely contained within it.

The word “assignable” appears in many TypeScript errors. In the context of sets of

values, it means either “member of ” (for a relationship between a value and a type) or

“subset of ” (for a relationship between two types):

```
const a: AB = 'A'; // OK, value 'A' is a member of the set {'A', 'B'}
const c: AB = 'C';
// ~ Type '"C"' is not assignable to type 'AB'
```
The type "C" is a literal type. Its domain consists of the single value "C". This is not a

subset of the domain of AB (which consists of the values "A" and "B"), so this is an

error. At the end of the day, much of what the type checker is doing is testing whether

one set is a subset of another:

```
// OK, {"A", "B"} is a subset of {"A", "B"}:
const ab: AB = Math.random() < 0.5? 'A' : 'B';
const ab12: AB12 = ab; // OK, {"A", "B"} is a subset of {"A", "B", 12}
```
```
declare let twelve: AB12;
const back: AB = twelve;
// ~~~~ Type 'AB12' is not assignable to type 'AB'
// Type '12' is not assignable to type 'AB'
```
The sets for these types are straightforward to reason about because they are finite.

You can compare the elements one by one. But most types that you work with in

practice have infinite domains. Reasoning about these can be harder. You can think of

them as either being built by listing out their elements:

**34 | Chapter 2: TypeScript’s Type System**


```
type Int = 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 // | ...
```
or by describing their members:

```
interface Identified {
id: string ;
}
```
Think of this interface as a description of the values in the domain of its type. Is the

value an object? Does it have an id property whose value is assignable to string?

Then it’s an Identified.

That’s all it says. As Item 4 explained, TypeScript’s structural typing rules mean that

the value could have other properties, too. It could even be callable! This fact can

sometimes be obscured by excess property checking (see Item 11).

Thinking of types as sets of values helps you reason about operations on them. For

example:

```
interface Person {
name: string ;
}
interface Lifespan {
birth: Date;
death?: Date;
}
type PersonSpan = Person & Lifespan;
```
The & operator computes the intersection of two types. What sorts of values belong to

the PersonSpan type? On first glance, the Person and Lifespan interfaces have no

properties in common, so you might expect it to be the empty set (i.e., the never

type). But type operations apply to the sets of values (the domain of the type), not to

the properties in the interface. And remember that values with additional properties

still belong to a type. So a value that has the properties of both Person and Lifespan

will belong to the intersection type:

```
const ps: Person Span = {
name: 'Alan Turing',
birth: new Date('1912/06/23'),
death: new Date('1954/06/07'),
}; // OK
```
Of course, a value could have more than those three properties and still belong to the

type! The general rule is that the values in an intersection type contain the union of

properties in each of its constituents.

The intuition about intersecting properties is correct, but for the union of two inter‐

faces, rather than their intersection:

```
type K = keyof (Person | Lifespan);
// ^? type K = never
```
```
Item 7: Think of Types as Sets of Values | 35
```

There are no keys that TypeScript can be certain will be present on a value in the

union type, so keyof for the union must be the empty set (never). Or, more formally:

```
// Disclaimer: these are relationships, not TypeScript code!
keyof (A&B) = ( keyof A) | ( keyof B)
keyof (A|B) = ( keyof A) & ( keyof B)
```
If you can build an intuition for why these equations hold, you’ll have come a long

way toward understanding TypeScript’s type system!

A more idiomatic way to write the PersonSpan type would be with extends:

```
interface Person {
name: string ;
}
interface PersonSpan extends Person {
birth: Date;
death?: Date;
}
```
Thinking of types as sets of values, what does extends mean? Just like “assignable to,”

you can read it as “subset of.” Every value in PersonSpan must have a name property

that is a string. And every value must also have a birth property, so it’s a proper

subset.

While extends is typically used to add fields to an interface, anything matching a

subset of the values of the base type will do. This lets you model more nuanced type

relationships:

```
interface NullyStudent {
name: string ;
ageYears: number | null ;
}
interface Student extends NullyStudent {
ageYears: number ;
}
```
Not every language would let you change the type of ageYears like this, but so long as

it’s assignable to the type in the base type (NullyStudent), TypeScript allows it. This

makes sense when you think about the domains of these two interfaces. If you try

to expand the type of ageYears instead, you’ll get an error:

```
interface StringyStudent extends NullyStudent {
// ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
// Interface 'StringyStudent' incorrectly extends interface 'NullyStudent'.
ageYears: number | string ;
}
```
**36 | Chapter 2: TypeScript’s Type System**


You might hear the term “subtype.” This is another way of saying that one type’s

domain is a subset of the other’s. Thinking in terms of one-, two-, and three-

dimensional vectors:

```
interface Vector1D { x: number ; }
interface Vector2D extends Vector1D { y: number ; }
interface Vector3D extends Vector2D { z: number ; }
```
You’d say that a Vector3D is a subtype of Vector2D, which is a subtype of Vector1D (in

the context of classes, you’d say “subclass”). This relationship is usually drawn as a

hierarchy, but thinking in terms of sets of values, a Venn diagram is more appropriate

(see Figure 2-9).

Figure 2-9. Two ways of thinking of type relationships: as a hierarchy or as overlapping

sets.

With the Venn diagram, it’s clear that the subset/subtype/assignability relationships

are unchanged if you rewrite the interfaces without extends:

```
interface Vector1D { x: number ; }
interface Vector2D { x: number ; y: number ; }
interface Vector3D { x: number ; y: number ; z: number ; }
```
The sets haven’t changed, so neither has the Venn diagram.

While both interpretations are workable for object types, the set interpretation

becomes much more intuitive when you start thinking about literal types and union

types.

The extends keyword can also appear as a constraint in a generic type, and it also

means “subset of ” in this context (Item 15):

```
function getKey<K extends string >(val: any , key: K) {
// ...
}
```
What does it mean to extend string? If you’re used to thinking in terms of object

inheritance, it’s hard to interpret. You could define a subclass of the object wrapper

type String (Item 10), but that seems inadvisable.

```
Item 7: Think of Types as Sets of Values | 37
```

Thinking in terms of sets, on the other hand, it stands to reason that any type whose

domain is a subset of string will do. This includes string literal types, unions of

string literal types, template literal types (Item 54), and string itself:

```
getKey({}, 'x'); // OK, 'x' extends string
getKey({}, Math.random() < 0.5? 'a' : 'b'); // OK, 'a'|'b' extends string
getKey({}, document.title); // OK, string extends string
getKey({}, 12);
// ~~ Type 'number' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'
```
“extends” has turned into “assignable” in the last error, but this shouldn’t trip us up

since we know to read both as “subset of.”

The set interpretation also makes more sense when you have types whose relationship

isn’t strictly hierarchical. What’s the relationship between string|number and

string|Date, for instance? Their intersection is non-empty (it’s string), but neither

is a subtype of the other. The relationship between their domains is clear, even though

these types don’t fit into a strict hierarchy (see Figure 2-10).

Figure 2-10. Union types may not fit into a hierarchy but can be thought of in terms of

sets of values.

Thinking of types as sets can also clarify the relationships between arrays and tuples.

For example:

```
const list = [1, 2];
// ^? const list: number[]
const tuple: [ number , number ] = list;
// ~~~~~ Type 'number[]' is not assignable to type '[number, number]'
// Target requires 2 element(s) but source may have fewer
```
Are there lists of numbers that are not pairs of numbers? Sure! The empty list and the

list [1] are examples. It therefore makes sense that number[] is not assignable to

[number, number] since it’s not a subset of it. (The reverse assignment does work.)

Is a triple assignable to a pair? Thinking in terms of structural typing, you might

expect it to be. A pair has 0 and 1 keys, so mightn’t it have others, too, like 2?

```
const triple: [ number , number , number ] = [1, 2, 3];
const double : [ number , number ] = triple;
// ~~~~~~ '[number, number, number]' is not assignable to '[number, number]'
// Source has 3 element(s) but target allows only 2.
```
**38 | Chapter 2: TypeScript’s Type System**


The answer is “no,” and for an interesting reason. Rather than modeling a pair of

numbers as {0: number, 1: number}, TypeScript models it as {0: number, 1:

number, length: 2}. This makes sense—you can check the length of a tuple—and it

precludes this assignment. And that’s probably for the best!

TypeScript is constantly testing for assignability which, as you’ve seen many times

now, is a subset/subtype relationship. Interestingly, TypeScript rarely checks for type

equality. This makes it challenging to write tests for types, which is the subject of

Item 55.

If types are best thought of as sets of values, that means that two types with the same

sets of values are the same. And indeed this is true (with one caveat, explained

below). Unless two types are semantically different and just happen to have the same

domain, there’s no reason to define the same type twice.

At the extreme opposite end of the spectrum from never (the empty type) is unknown.

The domain of this type is all values in JavaScript. Every type is assignable to unknown.

Since it sits on top of the type hierarchy, it’s called a “top type.” Item 46 explains how

to use the unknown type in your own code.

Finally, it’s worth noting that not all sets of values correspond to TypeScript types.

There is no TypeScript type for all the integers, or for all the objects that have x and y

properties but no others. You can sometimes subtract types using Exclude, but only

when it would result in a proper TypeScript type:

```
type T = Exclude< string |Date, string | number >;
// ^? type T = Date
type NonZeroNums = Exclude< number , 0>;
// ^? type NonZeroNums = number
```
Table 2-1 summarizes the correspondence between TypeScript terms and terms from

set theory.

Table 2-1. TypeScript terms and set terms

```
TypeScript term Set term
never ∅ (empty set)
Literal type Single element set
Value assignable to T Value ∈ T (member of)
T1 assignable to T2 T1 ⊆ T2 (subset of)
T1 extends T2 T1 ⊆ T2 (subset of)
T1 | T2 T1 ∪ T2 (union)
T1 & T2 T1 ∩ T2 (intersection)
unknown Universal set
```
```
Item 7: Think of Types as Sets of Values | 39
```

There’s an important caveat to this interpretation: it works best when you think of

values as immutable. For example, what’s the difference between these two types?

```
interface Lockbox {
code: number ;
}
interface ReadonlyLockbox {
readonly code: number ;
}
```
The domain of these two types is precisely the same, but they’re observably different:

```
const box: Lockbox = { code: 4216 };
const robox: ReadonlyLockbox = { code: 3625 };
box.code = 1234; // ok
robox.code = 1234;
// ~~~~ Cannot assign to 'code' because it is a read-only property.
```
For this reason, you’ll sometimes hear a variation on this item’s title: “types are sets of

values and the things you can do with them.” Item 14 has more to say about readonly

but, as a general rule, the type checker is more effective when you work with immuta‐

ble values.

**Things to Remember**

- Think of types as sets of values (the type’s domain). These sets can either be finite
    (e.g., boolean or literal types) or infinite (e.g., number or string).
- TypeScript types form intersecting sets (a Venn diagram) rather than a strict hier‐
    archy. Two types can overlap without either being a subtype of the other.
- Remember that an object can still belong to a type even if it has additional prop‐
    erties that were not mentioned in the type declaration.
- Type operations apply to a set’s domain. The domain of A | B is the union of the
    domains of A and B.
- Think of “extends,” “assignable to,” and “subtype of ” as synonyms for “subset of.”

#### Item 8: Know How to Tell Whether a Symbol Is in the

#### Type Space or Value Space

A symbol in TypeScript exists in one of two spaces:

- Type space
- Value space

**40 | Chapter 2: TypeScript’s Type System**


This can get confusing because the same name can refer to different things depending

on which space it’s in:

```
interface Cylinder {
radius: number ;
height: number ;
}
```
```
const Cylinder = (radius: number , height: number ) => ({radius, height});
```
interface Cylinder introduces a symbol in type space. const Cylinder introduces

a symbol with the same name in value space. They have nothing to do with one

another. Depending on the context, when you write Cylinder, you’ll either be refer‐

ring to the type or the value. Sometimes this can lead to errors:

```
function calculateVolume(shape: unknown ) {
if (shape instanceof Cylinder) {
shape.radius
// ~~~~~~ Property 'radius' does not exist on type '{}'
}
}
```
What’s going on here? You probably intended the instanceof to check whether the

shape was of the Cylinder type. But instanceof is JavaScript’s runtime operator, and

it operates on values. So instanceof Cylinder refers to the function, not the type.

It’s not always obvious at first glance whether a symbol is in type space or value space.

You have to tell from the context in which the symbol occurs. This can get especially

confusing because many type-space constructs look exactly the same as value-space

constructs.

Literal types, for example:

```
type T1 = 'string literal';
const v1 = 'string literal';
type T2 = 123;
const v2 = 123;
```
The symbols after a type or interface are in type space, while those introduced in a

const or let declaration are values.

One of the best ways to build an intuition for the two spaces is through the Type‐

Script playground, which shows you the generated JavaScript for your TypeScript

source. Types are erased during compilation (Item 3), so if a symbol disappears then

it was in type space (see Figure 2-11).

```
Item 8: Know How to Tell Whether a Symbol Is in the Type Space or Value Space | 41
```

Figure 2-11. The TypeScript playground showing generated JavaScript. The symbols on

the first two lines go away, so they were in type space.

Statements in TypeScript can alternate between type space and value space. The sym‐

bols after a type declaration (:) or an assertion (as) are in type space, while every‐

thing after an = in an assignment is in value space. For example:

```
interface Person {
first: string ;
last: string ;
}
const jane: Person = { first: 'Jane', last: 'Jacobs' };
// ―――― ――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――― Values
// ―――――― Type
```
Function statements, in particular, can alternate repeatedly between the spaces:

```
function email(to: Person , subject: string , body: string ): Response {
// ――――― ―― ――――――― ―――― Values
// ―――――― ―――――― ―――――― ―――――――― Types
// ...
}
```
The class and enum constructs introduce both a type and a value. Returning to the

first example, for instance, Cylinder could have been a class:

```
class Cylinder {
radius: number ;
height: number ;
constructor (radius: number , height: number ) {
this .radius = radius;
this .height = height;
}
}
```
```
function calculateVolume(shape: unknown ) {
if (shape instanceof Cylinder) {
shape
// ^? (parameter) shape: Cylinder
```
**42 | Chapter 2: TypeScript’s Type System**


```
shape.radius
// ^? (property) Cylinder.radius: number
}
}
```
The TypeScript type introduced by a class is based on its shape (its properties and

methods), while the value is the constructor.

There are many operators and keywords that mean different things in a type or value

context. typeof, for instance:

```
type T1 = typeof jane;
// ^? type T1 = Person
type T2 = typeof email;
// ^? type T2 = (to: Person, subject: string, body: string) => Response
```
```
const v1 = typeof jane; // Value is "object"
const v2 = typeof email; // Value is "function"
```
In a type context, typeof takes a value and returns its TypeScript type. You can use

these as part of a larger type expression, or use a type statement to give them a name.

In a value context, typeof is JavaScript’s runtime typeof operator. It returns a string

containing the runtime type of the symbol. This is not the same as the TypeScript

type! JavaScript’s runtime type system is much simpler than TypeScript’s static type

system. In contrast to the infinite variety of TypeScript types, JavaScript’s typeof

operator only has eight possible return values: "string", "number", "boolean",

"undefined", "object", "function", "symbol", and "bigint".

The [] property accessor also has an identical-looking equivalent in type space. But

be aware that while obj['field'] and obj.field are equivalent in value space, they

are not in type space. You must use the former to get the type of another type’s

property:

```
const first: Person ['first'] = jane['first']; // Or jane.first
// ――――― ――――――――――――― Values
// ―――――― ――――――― Types
```
Person['first'] is a type here since it appears in a type context (after a :). You can

put any type in the index slot, including union types or primitive types:

```
type PersonEl = Person['first' | 'last'];
// ^? type PersonEl = string
type Tuple = [ string , number , Date];
type TupleEl = Tuple[ number ];
// ^? type TupleEl = string | number | Date
```
See Item 15 for more on type operations and how to map between types.

```
Item 8: Know How to Tell Whether a Symbol Is in the Type Space or Value Space | 43
```

There are many other constructs that have different meanings in the two spaces:

- this in value space is JavaScript’s this keyword (Item 69). As a type, this is the
    TypeScript type of this, aka “polymorphic this.” It’s helpful for implementing
    method chains with subclasses.
- In value space, & and | are bitwise AND and OR. In type space they are the inter‐
    section and union operators.
- In value space, const introduces a new variable, but in type space, as const
    changes the inferred type of a literal or literal expression (Item 20).
- In value space, extends defines a subclass (class A extends B), but in type
    space it defines a subtype (interface A extends B) or a constraint on a generic
    type (Generic<T extends number>).
- In value space, "in" is used in for loops (for (key in object)), while in type
    space it’s used in mapped types (Item 15).
- In value space,! is JavaScript’s logical not operator (!x), but in type space it’s a
    non-null type assertion (x!; see Item 9).

If TypeScript doesn’t seem to understand your code at all, it may be because of confu‐

sion around type and value space. For example, say you change the email function

from earlier to take its arguments in a single object parameter (Item 38 explains why

this is a good idea):

```
function email(options: {to: Person , subject: string , body: string }) {
// ...
}
```
In JavaScript you can use destructuring assignment to create local variables for each

property in the object:

```
function email({to, subject, body}) {
// ...
}
```
If you try to do the same in TypeScript, you get some confusing errors:

```
function email({
to: Person ,
// ~~~~~~ Binding element 'Person' implicitly has an 'any' type
subject: string ,
// ~~~~~~ Binding element 'string' implicitly has an 'any' type
body: string
// ~~~~~~ Binding element 'string' implicitly has an 'any' type
}) { /* ... */ }
```
**44 | Chapter 2: TypeScript’s Type System**


The problem is that Person and string are being interpreted in a value context.

You’re trying to create a variable named Person and two variables named string.

Instead, you should separate the types and values:

```
function email(
{to, subject, body}: {to: Person , subject: string , body: string }
) {
// ...
}
```
This is significantly more verbose, but in practice you may have a named type for the

parameters or be able to infer them from context (Item 24).

While the similar constructs in type and value space can be confusing at first, they’re

eventually useful as a mnemonic once you get the hang of it.

**Things to Remember**

- Know how to tell whether you’re in type space or value space while reading a
    TypeScript expression. Use the TypeScript playground to build an intuition for
    this.
- Every value has a static type, but this is only accessible in type space. Type space
    constructs such as type and interface are erased and are not accessible in value
    space.
- Some constructs, such as class or enum, introduce both a type and a value.
- typeof, this, and many other operators and keywords have different meanings
    in type space and value space.

### Item 9: Prefer Type Annotations to Type Assertions

TypeScript seems to have two ways of assigning a value to a variable and giving it a

type:

```
interface Person { name: string };
```
```
const alice: Person = { name: 'Alice' };
// ^? const alice: Person
const bob = { name: 'Bob' } as Person;
// ^? const bob: Person
```
While these achieve similar ends, they are actually quite different! The first (alice:

Person) adds a type annotation to the variable and ensures that the value conforms to

the type. The latter (as Person) performs a type assertion. This tells TypeScript that,

despite the type it inferred, you know better and would like the type to be Person.

```
Item 9: Prefer Type Annotations to Type Assertions | 45
```

In general, you should prefer type annotations to type assertions. Here’s why:

```
const alice: Person = {};
// ~~~~~ Property 'name' is missing in type '{}' but required in type 'Person'
const bob = {} as Person; // No error
```
The type annotation verifies that the value conforms to the interface. Since it does

not, TypeScript flags an error. The type assertion silences this error by telling the type

checker that, for whatever reason, you know better than it does.

The same thing happens if you specify an additional property:

```
const alice: Person = {
name: 'Alice',
occupation: 'TypeScript developer'
// ~~~~~~~~~ Object literal may only specify known properties,
// and 'occupation' does not exist in type 'Person'
};
const bob = {
name: 'Bob',
occupation: 'JavaScript developer'
} as Person; // No error
```
While undeclared properties are valid from a structural typing perspective (Item 4),

they are often mistakes. TypeScript has an additional tool known as excess property

checking that flags extra properties in objects with declared types, but it doesn’t apply

if you use an assertion. Item 11 will have much more to say about excess property

checking.

Because they provide additional safety checks, you should use type annotations

unless you have a specific reason to use a type assertion.

```
You may also see code that looks like const bob = <Person>{}.
This was the original syntax for assertions and is equivalent to {}
as Person. It is less common now because <Person> is interpreted
as a start tag in .tsx files (TypeScript + React).
```
It can be tricky to use a type annotation with arrow functions. What if you wanted to

use the named Person interface in this code?

```
const people = ['alice', 'bob', 'jan'].map(name => ({name}));
// { name: string; }[]... but we want Person[]
```
It’s tempting to use a type assertion here, and it seems to solve the problem:

```
const people = ['alice', 'bob', 'jan'].map(
name => ({name} as Person)
); // Type is Person[]
```
**46 | Chapter 2: TypeScript’s Type System**


But this suffers from all the same issues as a more direct use of type assertions. For

example:

```
const people = ['alice', 'bob', 'jan'].map(name => ({} as Person));
// No error
```
So how do you use a type annotation in this context instead? The most straightfor‐

ward way is to declare a variable in the arrow function:

```
const people = ['alice', 'bob', 'jan'].map(name => {
const person: Person = {name};
return person
}); // Type is Person[]
```
But this introduces considerable noise compared to the original code. A more concise

way is to annotate the return type of the arrow function:

```
const people = ['alice', 'bob', 'jan'].map(
(name): Person => ({name})
); // Type is Person[]
```
This performs all the same checks on the value as the previous version. The parenthe‐

ses are significant here! (name): Person allows the type of name to be inferred and

specifies that the return type should be Person. But (name: Person) would specify

that the type of name is Person while allowing the return type to be inferred, which

would produce an error. See Item 24 for more about how type inference works with

function parameters.

In this case you could have also written the final desired type and let TypeScript

check the validity of the assignment:

```
const people: Person [] = ['alice', 'bob', 'jan'].map(name => ({name})); // OK
```
But in the context of a longer chain of function calls, it may be necessary or desirable

to have the named type in place earlier. And it will help flag errors close to where they

occur.

So when should you use a type assertion? Type assertions make the most sense when

you truly do know more about a type than TypeScript does, typically from context

that isn’t available to the type checker. If you’re working in a browser, for instance,

you may know the type of a DOM element more precisely than TypeScript does:

```
document.querySelector('#myButton')?.addEventListener('click', e => {
e.currentTarget
// ^? (property) Event.currentTarget: EventTarget | null
// currentTarget is #myButton is a button element
const button = e.currentTarget as HTMLButtonElement;
// ^? const button: HTMLButtonElement
});
```
```
Item 9: Prefer Type Annotations to Type Assertions | 47
```

Because TypeScript doesn’t have access to the DOM of your page, it has no way of

knowing that #myButton is a button element. And it doesn’t know that the current

Target of the event should be that same button. Since you have information that

TypeScript does not, a type assertion makes sense here. For more on DOM types, see

Item 75.

When you use a type assertion, it’s a good idea to include an explanation of why it’s

valid in a comment. This provides the missing information for human readers and

will help them evaluate whether the assertion is still justified.

What if a variable’s type includes null but you know from context that this isn’t possi‐

ble? You can use a type assertion to remove null from a type:

```
const elNull = document.getElementById('foo');
// ^? const elNull: HTMLElement | null
const el = document.getElementById('foo') as HTMLElement;
// ^? const el: HTMLElement
```
This sort of type assertion is so common that it gets a special syntax and is known as a

non-null assertion:

```
const el = document.getElementById('foo')!;
// ^? const el: HTMLElement
```
Used as a prefix,! is JavaScript’s logical not operator. But as a suffix,! is interpreted

as a type assertion that the value is non-null. This is an improvement over as because

it allows the non-null part of the type to pass through unaltered.

Still, you should treat! with as much caution as any other assertion: it is erased dur‐

ing compilation, so you should only use it if you have information that the type

checker lacks and can ensure that the value is non-null. If you can’t, you should use a

conditional to check for the null case.

If you’re accessing a property or method on an object that might be null, it can be

convenient to use the “optional chaining” operator, ?.:

```
document.getElementById('foo')?.addEventListener('click', () => {
alert('Hi there!');
});
```
This has some superficial resemblance to !. but it’s quite different. a?.b is a Java‐

Script construct that checks if the object is null (or undefined) at runtime before

continuing to evaluate the expression. a!.b is a type-level construct that compiles to

just a.b. If the object is null at runtime, it will throw an exception. a?.b is safer than

a!.b, but don’t go too crazy with it. If it’s essential for your application to add an

event listener, then you probably want to know if it fails!

Type assertions have their limits: they don’t let you convert between arbitrary types.

The general rule is that you can use a type assertion to convert between A and B if

**48 | Chapter 2: TypeScript’s Type System**


they are “comparable” to one another. Using the set terminology from Item 7, this

means that A and B must have a non-empty intersection. In particular, subtypes are

allowed. HTMLElement is a subtype of HTMLElement | null, so this type assertion is

OK. (The intersection of these types is HTMLElement.) HTMLButtonElement is a sub‐

type of EventTarget, so that is OK, too. And Person is a subtype of {}, so that asser‐

tion is also fine.

But you can’t convert between a Person and an HTMLElement since their intersection

is empty (i.e., the never type):

```
interface Person { name: string ; }
const body = document.body;
const el = body as Person;
// ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
// Conversion of type 'HTMLElement' to type 'Person' may be a mistake because
// neither type sufficiently overlaps with the other. If this was intentional,
// convert the expression to 'unknown' first.
```
The error suggests an escape hatch, namely, using the unknown type (Item 46). Every

type is a subtype of unknown, so assertions involving unknown are always OK. This lets

you convert between arbitrary types, but at least you’re being explicit that you’re

doing something suspicious!

```
const el = document.body as unknown as Person; // OK
```
Not every type assertion uses the keyword as. Item 22 explains “user-defined type

guards” (is), which allow you to associate some logic with a type assertion to check

whether it’s valid. It’s also possible to use generic type inference to assert a type, but

this is a bad idea since it’s easy to convince yourself that TypeScript is checking your

types when it’s really not. This pattern (“return-only generics”) is explored in Item 51.

Type assertions are sometimes called “casts.” This terminology is misleading, how‐

ever, and is best avoided. In languages like C, a cast can change a value at runtime

(say from an int to a float). Type assertions cannot do this. They are type-level con‐

structs that are erased at runtime. They don’t change a value. Rather, they “assert”

something that is already true about it.

Finally, there’s as const. While this looks like a type assertion, it’s more properly

called a “const context.” While as T should make you suspicious, as const makes

types more precise and is completely safe. Item 24 shows how you can use const con‐

texts to improve type inference.

**Things to Remember**

- Prefer type annotations (: Type) to type assertions (as Type).
- Know how to annotate the return type of an arrow function.

```
Item 9: Prefer Type Annotations to Type Assertions | 49
```

- Use type assertions and non-null assertions only when you know something
    about types that TypeScript does not.
- When you use a type assertion, include a comment explaining why it’s valid.

#### Item 10: Avoid Object Wrapper Types (String, Number,

#### Boolean, Symbol, BigInt)

In addition to objects, JavaScript has seven types of primitive values: strings, num‐

bers, booleans, null, undefined, symbol, and bigint. The first five have been around

since the beginning. The symbol primitive was added in ES2015, and bigint joined

the family with ES2020.

Primitives are distinguished from objects by being immutable and not having meth‐

ods. You might object that strings do have methods:

```
> 'primitive'.charAt(3)
'm'
```
But things are not quite as they seem. There’s actually something surprising and sub‐

tle going on here. While a string primitive does not have methods, JavaScript also

defines a String object type that does. JavaScript freely converts between these types.

When you access a method like charAt on a string primitive, JavaScript wraps it in a

String object, calls the method, and then throws the object away.

You can observe this if you monkey-patch String.prototype (Item 47):

```
// Don't do this!
const originalCharAt = String.prototype.charAt;
String.prototype.charAt = function (pos) {
console.log( this , typeof this , pos);
return originalCharAt.call( this , pos);
};
console.log('primitive'.charAt(3));
```
This produces the following output:

```
[String: 'primitive'] object 3
m
```
The this value in the method is a String object wrapper, not a string primitive. You

can instantiate a String object directly and it will sometimes behave like a string

primitive. But not always. For example, a String object is only ever equal to itself:

```
> "hello" === new String("hello")
false
> new String("hello") === new String("hello")
false
```
**50 | Chapter 2: TypeScript’s Type System**


The implicit conversion to object wrapper types explains an odd phenomenon in

JavaScript—if you assign a property to a primitive, it disappears:

```
> x = "hello"
'hello'
> x.language = 'English'
'English'
> x.language
undefined
```
Now you know the explanation: x is converted to a String instance, the language

property is set on that, and then the object (with its language property) is thrown

away.

There are object wrapper types for the other primitives as well: Number for numbers,

Boolean for booleans, Symbol for symbols, and BigInt for bigints (there are no object

wrappers for null and undefined).

These wrapper types exist as a convenience to provide methods on the primitive val‐

ues and to provide static methods (e.g., String.fromCharCode). But there’s usually no

reason to instantiate them directly.

TypeScript models this distinction by having distinct types for the primitives and

their object wrappers:

- string and String
- number and Number
- boolean and Boolean
- symbol and Symbol
- bigint and BigInt

It’s easy to inadvertently type String (especially if you’re coming from Java or C#),

and it even seems to work, at least initially:

```
function getStringLen(foo: String) {
return foo.length;
}
```
```
getStringLen("hello"); // OK
getStringLen( new String("hello")); // OK
```
But things go awry when you try to pass a String object to a method that expects a

string:

```
function isGreeting(phrase: String) {
return ['hello', 'good day'].includes(phrase);
// ~~~~~~
// Argument of type 'String' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'.
```
```
Item 10: Avoid Object Wrapper Types (String, Number, Boolean, Symbol, BigInt) | 51
```

```
// 'string' is a primitive, but 'String' is a wrapper object.
// Prefer using 'string' when possible.
}
```
So string is assignable to String, but String is not assignable to string. Confusing?

Follow the advice in the error message and stick with string. All the type declara‐

tions that ship with TypeScript use it, as do the typings for almost all other libraries.

Another way you can wind up with wrapper objects is if you provide an explicit type

annotation with a capital letter:

```
const s: String = "primitive";
const n: Number = 12;
const b: Boolean = true ;
```
This only changes the TypeScript types and, as Item 3 explained, this can’t affect the

runtime values. They are still primitives, not objects. But TypeScript permits these

declarations because the primitive types are assignable to the object wrappers. These

annotations are both misleading and redundant (Item 18). Better to stick with the

primitive types.

As a final note, it’s fine to call BigInt and Symbol without new, since these create

primitives:

```
> typeof BigInt(1234)
'bigint'
> typeof Symbol('sym')
'symbol'
```
These are the BigInt and Symbol values, not the TypeScript types (Item 8). Calling

them results in values of type bigint and symbol. You can construct a bigint directly

by putting an “n” at the end of a numeric literal: 123n.

If you use typescript-eslint in your project, the ban-types rule prohibits the use

of object wrapper types. This is enabled with the @typescript-eslint/recommended

configuration.

**Things to Remember**

- Avoid TypeScript object wrapper types. Use the primitive types instead: string
    instead of String, number instead of Number, boolean instead of Boolean, symbol
    instead of Symbol, and bigint instead of BigInt.
- Understand how object wrapper types are used to provide methods on primitive
    values. Avoid instantiating them or using them directly, with the exception of
    Symbol and BigInt.

**52 | Chapter 2: TypeScript’s Type System**


### Item 11: Distinguish Excess Property Checking from Type Checking

When you assign an object literal to a variable with a declared type, TypeScript makes

sure it has the properties of that type and no others:

```
interface Room {
numDoors: number ;
ceilingHeightFt: number ;
}
const r: Room = {
numDoors: 1,
ceilingHeightFt: 10,
elephant: 'present',
// ~~~~~~~ Object literal may only specify known properties,
// and 'elephant' does not exist in type 'Room'
};
```
While it is odd that there’s an elephant property, this error doesn’t make much sense

from a structural typing point of view (Item 4). That constant is assignable to the

Room type, which you can see by introducing an intermediate variable:

```
const obj = {
numDoors: 1,
ceilingHeightFt: 10,
elephant: 'present',
};
const r: Room = obj; // OK
```
The type of obj is inferred as { numDoors: number; ceilingHeightFt: number;

elephant: string }. This type includes a subset of the values in the Room type

because it only permits string elephants, whereas Room would permit any type of ele‐

phant. Hence it is assignable to Room, and the code passes the type checker. (If the

term “subset” is unfamiliar, head over to Item 7 for a refresher.)

So what’s different about these two examples? In the first you’ve triggered a process

known as “excess property checking,” which helps catch an important class of errors

that the structural type system would otherwise miss. But this process has its limits,

and conflating it with regular assignability checks can make it harder to build an intu‐

ition for structural typing. Recognizing excess property checking as a distinct process

will help you build a clearer mental model of TypeScript’s type system.

As Item 1 explained, TypeScript goes beyond trying to flag code that will throw

exceptions at runtime. It also tries to find code that doesn’t do what you intend. Here’s

an example of the latter:

```
interface Options {
title: string ;
darkMode?: boolean ;
```
```
Item 11: Distinguish Excess Property Checking from Type Checking | 53
```

##### }

```
function createWindow(options: Options) {
if (options.darkMode) {
setDarkMode();
}
// ...
}
createWindow({
title: 'Spider Solitaire',
darkmode: true
// ~~~~~~~ Object literal may only specify known properties,
// but 'darkmode' does not exist in type 'Options'.
// Did you mean to write 'darkMode'?
});
```
This code doesn’t throw any sort of error at runtime. But it’s also unlikely to do what

you intended for the exact reason that TypeScript says: it should be darkMode (capital

M), not darkmode.

A purely structural type checker wouldn’t be able to spot this sort of error because the

Options type is incredibly broad: it includes all objects with a title property that’s a

string and any other properties, so long as those don’t include a darkMode property

set to something other than true or false.

It’s easy to forget how expansive TypeScript types can be. Here are a few more values

that are assignable to Options:

```
const o1: Options = document; // OK
const o2: Options = new HTMLAnchorElement(); // OK
```
Both document and instances of HTMLAnchorElement have title properties that are

strings, so these assignments are allowed. Options is a broad type indeed!

Excess property checking tries to rein this in without compromising the fundamen‐

tally structural nature of the type system. It does this by disallowing unknown prop‐

erties on object literals when they’re used in a context with a declared type. (It’s

sometimes called “strict object literal checking” for this reason, or “freshness” because

it applies to freshly created objects.)

This context could be an assignment to a variable with a declared type, a function

argument, or the return value of a function with a declared return type. Neither docu

ment nor new HTMLAnchorElement is an object literal, so they did not trigger excess

property checking. But the {title, darkmode} object is, so it does:

```
const o: Options = { darkmode: true , title: 'Ski Free' };
// ~~~~~~~~ 'darkmode' does not exist in type 'Options'...
```
This explains why using an intermediate variable without a type annotation makes

the error go away:

**54 | Chapter 2: TypeScript’s Type System**


```
const intermediate = { darkmode: true , title: 'Ski Free' };
const o: Options = intermediate; // OK
```
While the righthand side of the first line is an object literal, the righthand side of the

second line (intermediate) is not, so excess property checking does not apply, and

the error goes away.

Excess property checking does not happen when you use a type assertion:

```
const o = { darkmode: true , title: 'MS Hearts' } as Options; // OK
```
This is a good reason to prefer type annotations to assertions (Item 9).

If you don’t want this sort of check, you can tell TypeScript to expect additional prop‐

erties using an index signature:

```
interface Options {
darkMode?: boolean ;
[otherOptions: string ]: unknown ;
}
const o: Options = { darkmode: true }; // OK
```
Item 16 discusses when this is and is not an appropriate way to model your data.

A related check happens for so-called “weak” types, which have only optional

properties:

```
interface LineChartOptions {
logscale?: boolean ;
invertedYAxis?: boolean ;
areaChart?: boolean ;
}
function setOptions(options: LineChartOptions) { /* ... */ }
```
```
const opts = { logScale: true };
setOptions(opts);
// ~~~~ Type '{ logScale: boolean; }' has no properties in common
// with type 'LineChartOptions'
```
From a structural point of view, the LineChartOptions type should include almost all

objects. For “weak” types like this, TypeScript adds another check to make sure that

the value type and declared type have at least one property in common. Much like

excess property checking, this is effective at catching typos and isn’t strictly structural.

But unlike excess property checking, it happens during all assignability checks involv‐

ing weak types. Factoring out an intermediate variable doesn’t bypass this check.

```
In TypeScript, “weak type” is a technical term that specifically
refers to interfaces with only optional properties. It has nothing to
do with the merits of your type, and the opposite of a “weak type”
is not a “strong type,” a term that has no specific meaning in Type‐
Script or programming languages in general.
```
```
Item 11: Distinguish Excess Property Checking from Type Checking | 55
```

Excess property checking is an effective way of catching typos and other mistakes in

property names that would otherwise be allowed by the structural typing system. It’s

particularly useful with types like Options that contain optional fields. But it is also

very limited in scope: it only applies to object literals. Recognize this limitation, and

distinguish between excess property checking and ordinary assignability checking.

This will help you build a mental model of both.

For a concrete example of how excess property checking can catch bugs and open up

new design possibilities, see Item 61.

**Things to Remember**

- When you assign an object literal to a variable with a known type or pass it as an
    argument to a function, it undergoes excess property checking.
- Excess property checking is an effective way to find errors, but it is distinct from
    the usual structural assignability checks done by the TypeScript type checker.
    Conflating these processes will make it harder for you to build a mental model of
    assignability. TypeScript types are not “closed” (Item 4).
- Be aware of the limits of excess property checking: introducing an intermediate
    variable will remove these checks.
- A “weak type” is an object type with only optional properties. For these types,
    assignability checks require at least one matching property.

### Item 12: Apply Types to Entire Function Expressions When Possible

JavaScript (and TypeScript) distinguishes between a function statement and a func‐

tion expression:

```
function rollDice1(sides: number ): number { /* ... */ } // Statement
const rollDice2 = function (sides: number ): number { /* ... */ }; // Expression
const rollDice3 = (sides: number ): number => { /* ... */ }; // Also expression
```
An advantage of function expressions in TypeScript is that you can apply a type dec‐

laration to the entire function at once, rather than specifying the types of the parame‐

ters and return type individually:

```
type DiceRollFn = (sides: number ) => number ;
const rollDice: DiceRollFn = sides => { /* ... */ };
```
If you mouse over sides in your editor, you’ll see that TypeScript knows its type is

number. The function type doesn’t provide much value in such a short example, but

the technique does open up a number of possibilities.

**56 | Chapter 2: TypeScript’s Type System**


One is reducing repetition. If you wanted to write several functions for doing arith‐

metic on numbers, for instance, you could write them like this:

```
function add(a: number , b: number ) { return a + b; }
function sub(a: number , b: number ) { return a - b; }
function mul(a: number , b: number ) { return a * b; }
function div(a: number , b: number ) { return a / b; }
```
or consolidate the repeated function signatures with a single function type:

```
type BinaryFn = (a: number , b: number ) => number ;
const add: BinaryFn = (a, b) => a + b;
const sub: BinaryFn = (a, b) => a - b;
const mul: BinaryFn = (a, b) => a * b;
const div: BinaryFn = (a, b) => a / b;
```
This has fewer type annotations than before, and they’re separated away from the

function implementations. This makes the logic more apparent. You’ve also gained a

check that the return type of all the function expressions is number.

Libraries often provide types for common function signatures. For example, the React

typings provide a MouseEventHandler type that you can apply to an entire function

rather than specifying MouseEvent as a type for the function’s parameter. If you’re a

library author, consider providing type declarations for common callbacks.

Another situation in which you should apply a type to a function expression is to

match the signature of some other function. In a web browser, for example, the fetch

function issues an HTTP request:

```
const response = fetch('/quote?by=Mark+Twain');
// ^? const response: Promise<Response>
```
You extract data from the response via response.json() or response.text():

```
async function getQuote() {
const response = await fetch('/quote?by=Mark+Twain');
const quote = await response.json();
return quote;
}
// {
// "quote": "If you tell the truth, you don't have to remember anything.",
// "source": "notebook",
// "date": "1894"
// }
```
(See Item 27 for more on Promises and async/await.)

There’s a bug here: if the request for /quote fails, the response body is likely to con‐

tain an explanation like “404 Not Found.” This isn’t JSON, so response.json() will

return a rejected Promise with a message about invalid JSON. This obscures the real

error, which was a 404.

```
Item 12: Apply Types to Entire Function Expressions When Possible | 57
```

It’s easy to forget that an error response with fetch does not result in a rejected

Promise. Let’s write a checkedFetch function to do the status check for us. The type

declarations for fetch in lib.dom.d.ts look like this:

```
declare function fetch(
input: RequestInfo, init?: RequestInit,
): Promise<Response>;
```
So you can write checkedFetch like this:

```
async function checkedFetch(input: RequestInfo, init?: RequestInit) {
const response = await fetch(input, init);
if (!response.ok) {
// An exception becomes a rejected Promise in an async function.
throw new Error(`Request failed: ${response.status}`);
}
return response;
}
```
This works, but it can be written more concisely:

```
const checkedFetch: typeof fetch = async (input, init) => {
const response = await fetch(input, init);
if (!response.ok) {
throw new Error(`Request failed: ${response.status}`);
}
return response;
}
```
We’ve changed from a function statement to a function expression and applied a type

(typeof fetch) to the entire function. This allows TypeScript to infer the types of the

input and init parameters.

The type annotation also guarantees that the return type of checkedFetch will be the

same as that of fetch. Had you written return instead of throw, for example, Type‐

Script would have caught the mistake:

```
const checkedFetch: typeof fetch = async (input, init) => {
// ~~~~~~~~~~~~
// 'Promise<Response | HTTPError>' is not assignable to 'Promise<Response>'
// Type 'Response | HTTPError' is not assignable to type 'Response'
const response = await fetch(input, init);
if (!response.ok) {
return new Error('Request failed: ' + response.status);
}
return response;
}
```
The same mistake in the first example would likely have led to an error, but in the

code that called checkedFetch, rather than in the implementation. In addition to

being more concise, typing this entire function expression instead of its parameters

has given you better safety.

**58 | Chapter 2: TypeScript’s Type System**


What if you want to match the parameter types of another function but change the

return type? This is possible using a rest parameter and the built-in Parameters util‐

ity type:

```
async function fetchANumber(
...args: Parameters< typeof fetch>
): Promise< number > {
const response = await checkedFetch(...args);
const num = Number( await response.text());
if (isNaN(num)) {
throw new Error(`Response was not a number.`);
}
return num;
}
```
If you inspect fetchANumber in your editor, you’ll see that args doesn’t appear at all.

It’s replaced by the parameter names for fetch, which is exactly what you want:

```
fetchANumber
// ^? function fetchANumber(
// input: RequestInfo | URL, init?: RequestInit | undefined
// ): Promise<number>
```
The syntax here is a bit more cumbersome than applying a type to an entire function.

Use your judgment on whether it would be better to just write out the parameter

types. Item 62 will discuss rest parameters in the context of generic types.

While you may or may not be aware of it, you benefit from this technique whenever

you pass a callback to another function. When you use the map or filter method of

an Array, for example, TypeScript is able to infer a type for the callback parameter,

and it applies that type to your function expression. For more on how context is used

in type inference, see Item 24.

When you’re writing a function that has the same type signature as another one, or

writing many functions with the same type signature, consider whether you can apply

a type declaration to entire functions, rather than repeating types of parameters and

return values. The words “many” and “repeating” are important here. Don’t take this

to extremes! You don’t need to factor out a type for every function. For the common

case of a single, standalone function with a distinct type signature, an old-fashioned

function statement is just fine. Use function types when there are many functions

with the same or related type signatures.

**Things to Remember**

- Consider applying type annotations to entire function expressions, rather than to
    their parameters and return type.
- If you’re writing the same type signature repeatedly, factor out a function type or
    look for an existing one.

```
Item 12: Apply Types to Entire Function Expressions When Possible | 59
```

- If you’re a library author, provide types for common callbacks.
- Use typeof fn to match the signature of another function, or Parameters and a
    rest parameter if you need to change the return type.

### Item 13: Know the Differences Between type and interface

If you want to define a named type in TypeScript, you have two options. You can use

a type alias, as shown here:

```
type TState = {
name: string ;
capital: string ;
};
```
or define an interface:

```
interface IState {
name: string ;
capital: string ;
}
```
(You could also use a class, but that is a JavaScript runtime concept that also intro‐

duces a value. See Item 8.)

Which should you use, type or interface? The line between these two options has

become increasingly blurred over the years, to the point that in most situations you

can use either. You should be aware of the distinctions that remain between type and

interface and be consistent about which you use in which situation. But you should

also know how to write the same types using both, so that you’ll be comfortable read‐

ing TypeScript that uses either.

For new code where you need to pick a style, the general rule of thumb is to use

interface where possible, using type either where it’s required (e.g., union types) or

has a cleaner syntax (e.g., function types). We’ll get to the arguments for this toward

the end of this item, but for now let’s explore the similarities and differences between

these two constructs.

```
The examples in this item prefix type names with I or T solely to
indicate how they were defined. You should not do this in your
code! Prefixing interface types with I is common in C#, and this
convention made some inroads in the early days of TypeScript. But
it is considered bad style today because it’s unnecessary, adds little
value, and is not consistently followed in the standard libraries.
```
**60 | Chapter 2: TypeScript’s Type System**


First, the similarities: the two State types are nearly indistinguishable from one

another. If you define an IState or a TState value with an extra property, the errors

you get from excess property checking (Item 11) are character-by-character identical:

```
const wyoming: TState = {
name: 'Wyoming',
capital: 'Cheyenne',
population: 578_000
// ~~~~~~~ Object literal may only specify known properties,
// and 'population' does not exist in type 'TState'
};
```
You can use an index signature with both interface and type:

```
type TDict = { [key: string ]: string };
interface IDict {
[key: string ]: string ;
}
```
You can also define function types with either:

```
type TFn = (x: number ) => string ;
interface IFn {
(x: number ): string ;
}
type TFnAlt = {
(x: number ): string ;
};
```
```
const toStrT: TFn = x => '' + x; // OK
const toStrI: IFn = x => '' + x; // OK
const toStrTAlt: TFnAlt = x => '' + x; // OK
```
The first type alias form (TFn) looks more natural and is more concise for function

types. This is the preferred form and is the one you’re most likely to encounter in type

declarations. The latter two forms reflect the fact that functions in JavaScript are call‐

able objects. They are sometimes useful with overloaded function signatures

(Item 52).

Both type aliases and interfaces can be generic:

```
type TBox<T> = {
value: T;
};
interface IBox<T> {
value: T;
}
```
```
Item 13: Know the Differences Between type and interface | 61
```

An interface can extend a type (with some caveats, explained momentarily), and a

type can extend an interface:

```
interface IStateWithPop extends TState {
population: number ;
}
type TStateWithPop = IState & { population: number ; };
```
Again, these types are identical. The caveat is that an interface can only extend

object types that could have been defined with interface (even if you happened to

define them with type). You can’t extend a union type, for example. If you want to do

that, you’ll need to use type and &.

A class can implement either an interface or a simple type:

```
class StateT implements TState {
name: string = '';
capital: string = '';
}
class StateI implements IState {
name: string = '';
capital: string = '';
}
```
Finally, both type and interface can be recursive (Item 57).

Those are the similarities. What about the differences? You’ve seen one already—

there are union types but no union interfaces:

```
type AorB = 'a' | 'b';
```
An interface can extend some types, but not this one. Extending union types can

sometimes be useful. If you have separate types for Input and Output variables and a

mapping from name to variable:

```
type Input = { /* ... */ };
type Output = { /* ... */ };
interface VariableMap {
[name: string ]: Input | Output;
}
```
then you might want a type that attaches the name to the variable. This would be:

```
type NamedVariable = (Input | Output) & { name: string };
```
This type cannot be expressed with interface. A type is, in general, more capable

than an interface. It can be a union, and it can also take advantage of fancy type-

level features like mapped types (Item 15) and conditional types (Item 52).

**62 | Chapter 2: TypeScript’s Type System**


interface and extends give a bit more error checking than type and &:

```
interface Person {
name: string ;
age: string ;
}
```
```
type TPerson = Person & { age: number ; }; // no error, unusable type
```
```
interface IPerson extends Person {
// ~~~~~~~ Interface 'IPerson' incorrectly extends interface 'Person'.
// Types of property 'age' are incompatible.
// Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'.
age: number ;
}
```
It’s fine to change the type of a property in a subtype, so long it’s compatible with the

base type (see Item 7). Generally you want more safety checks, so this is a good rea‐

son to use extends with interfaces.

Type aliases are the natural way to express tuple and array types:

```
type Pair = [a: number , b: number ];
type StringList = string [];
type NamedNums = [ string , ... number []];
```
An interface does have some abilities that a type doesn’t, however. One of these is

that an interface can be augmented. Going back to the State example, you could

have added a population field in another way:

```
interface IState {
name: string ;
capital: string ;
}
interface IState {
population: number ;
}
const wyoming: IState = {
name: 'Wyoming',
capital: 'Cheyenne',
population: 578_000
}; // OK
```
This is known as “declaration merging,” and it’s quite surprising if you’ve never seen it

before. This is primarily used with type declaration files (Chapter 8), and if you’re

writing one, you should follow the norms and use interface to support it. The idea

is that there may be gaps in your type declarations that users need to fill, and this is

how they do it. (Item 71 walks you through this process.)

```
Item 13: Know the Differences Between type and interface | 63
```

To understand why this unusual feature is useful, it’s instructive to look at how Type‐

Script itself uses declaration merging to model the different versions of JavaScript’s

standard library. The Array interface, for example, is defined in lib.es5.d.ts:

```
// lib.es5.d.ts
interface Array<T> {
/** Gets or sets the length of the array. */
length: number ;
// ...
[n: number ]: T;
}
```
If you set target to ES5 in your tsconfig.json (Item 2), then this is all you get. This

definition includes all the properties and methods that were available on arrays when

ES5 was published in 2009. But if you target ES2015, TypeScript will also include

lib.es2015.core.d.ts. This includes another declaration of the Array interface:

```
// lib.es2015.core.d.ts
interface Array<T> {
/** Returns the index of the first element in the array where predicate... */
findIndex(
predicate: (value: T, index: number , obj: T[]) => unknown ,
thisArg?: any
): number ;
```
```
// ... also find, fill, copyWithin
}
```
This declaration includes just the four new Array methods that were added in

ES2015: find, findIndex, fill, and copyWithin. They get added to the ES5 Array

interface via declaration merging. The net effect is that you get a single Array type

with exactly the right methods for the version of JavaScript that you’re targeting.

As the name implies, declaration merging makes the most sense in declaration files. It

can happen in user code, but only if the two interfaces are defined in the same

module (i.e., the same .ts file). This prevents accidental collisions with global inter

faces with generic-sounding names like Location and FormData.

Another difference is that TypeScript will always try to refer to an interface by its

name, whereas it takes more liberties replacing a type alias with its underlying defini‐

tion. You’ll sometimes see this in error messages and type display (Item 56) but it can

also affect concrete outputs such as .d.ts files, which TypeScript will emit if you set

declaration: true in your tsconfig.json.

For example, consider this function which returns an object statically typed using a

type alias with a limited scope:

```
export function getHummer() {
type Hummingbird = { name: string ; weightGrams: number ; };
const ruby: Hummingbird = { name: 'Ruby-throated', weightGrams: 3.4 };
```
**64 | Chapter 2: TypeScript’s Type System**


```
1 If you don’t see this error, make sure to set declaration: true set in your tsconfig.json.
```
```
return ruby;
};
```
```
const rubyThroat = getHummer();
// ^? const rubyThroat: Hummingbird
```
It’s interesting that TypeScript reports the type here using an out-of-scope type name

(Hummingbird). Even more interesting is what happens when you generate a .d.ts file

for this code:

```
// get-hummer.d.ts
export declare function getHummer(): {
name: string ;
weightGrams: number ;
};
```
Since there’s no function body in which to define the type alias (this is a type declara‐

tion file), TypeScript has elected to inline the type alias. The name is gone and only

the structure remains. Because the type system is structural (Item 4) this has no effect

on the values assignable to the type. But it does affect the display, and it affects the

generated .d.ts file. In some cases, this inlining behavior can cause duplication of

types extreme enough to affect compiler performance (Item 78).

Here’s what happens if you use an interface instead:

```
export function getHummer() {
// ~~~~~~~~~
// Return type of exported function has or is using private name 'Hummingbird'.
interface Hummingbird { name: string ; weightGrams: number ; };
const bee: Hummingbird = { name: 'Bee Hummingbird', weightGrams: 2.3 };
return bee;
};
```
Because Hummingbird is an interface, TypeScript wants to refer to it by name. But

the name isn’t available in the type declaration file, hence the error.^1 While the inlin‐

ing behavior may initially seem preferable here, it can lead to massive types and, as

Item 67 explains, it’s generally better to export your types anyway. The better solution

here is to keep the interface and make it a top-level export.

Returning to the question at the start of the item, should you use type or interface?

For complex types, you have no choice: you need to use a type alias. And for function

types, tuple types, and array types, the type syntax is more concise and natural than

the interface syntax. But what about simpler object types that can be represented

either way?

```
Item 13: Know the Differences Between type and interface | 65
```

If you’re working in a codebase with an established style, stick with that. You probably

won’t go too wrong.

For a new project without an established style, prefer interface. Your type name will

appear more consistently in error messages and type display, and you’ll get more

checks that you extend other interfaces correctly. Here’s what the official TypeScript

handbook has to say:

```
For the most part, you can choose based on personal preference, and TypeScript will
tell you if it needs something to be the other kind of declaration. If you would like a
heuristic, use interface until you need to use features from type.
```
In other words, use interface when you can and type when you must, or when it’s

more ergonomic. But don’t sweat it too much either way.

You can enforce consistent use of type or interface using typescript-eslint’s

consistent-type-definitions rule, which is part of the stylistic preset (it prefers

interface by default).

**Things to Remember**

- Understand the differences and similarities between type and interface.
- Know how to write the same types using either syntax.
- Be aware of declaration merging for interface and type inlining for type.
- For projects without an established style, prefer interface to type for object
    types.

### Item 14: Use readonly to Avoid Errors Associated with Mutation

Here’s some code to print the triangular numbers (1, 1 + 2 = 3, 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, etc.):

```
function printTriangles(n: number ) {
const nums = [];
for ( let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
nums.push(i);
console.log(arraySum(nums));
}
}
```
(We’ll get to the definition of arraySum shortly.)

This code appears straightforward, if inefficient, but here’s what happens when you

run it:

**66 | Chapter 2: TypeScript’s Type System**


```
> printTriangles(5);
0
1
2
3
4
```
Whoops! Those aren’t the numbers we were expecting. What went wrong? Let’s take a

look at my implementation of arraySum:

```
function arraySum(arr: number []) {
let sum = 0, num;
while ((num = arr.pop()) !== undefined ) {
sum += num;
}
return sum;
}
```
This function does calculate the sum of the numbers in the array. But it also has the

side effect of emptying the array! TypeScript is fine with this, because JavaScript

arrays are mutable. The problem is that printTriangles made an assumption about

arraySum, namely that it doesn’t modify nums.

Mutation is the root cause of many hard-to-find bugs. Mutable is the default in Java‐

Script, but TypeScript’s readonly modifier can help you catch and prevent surprise

mutations. Because it can prevent such a pernicious set of bugs, it’s worth learning

how to use this feature in your own code.

JavaScript primitives are already immutable. There are no methods on string,

number, or boolean that will mutate these values. (You may reassign a variable

declared with let to another primitive, but you are not changing the primitive value

itself.)

As you saw with the destructive arraySum function, arrays (and objects) very much

are mutable. This is where TypeScript’s readonly modifier comes in.

Placed on a property in an object type, readonly prevents assignments to that

property:

```
interface PartlyMutableName {
readonly first: string ;
last: string ;
}
```
```
const jackie: PartlyMutableName = { first: 'Jacqueline', last: 'Kennedy' };
jackie.last = 'Onassis'; // OK
jackie.first = 'Jacky';
// ~~~~~ Cannot assign to 'first' because it is a read-only property.
```
Typically, you’ll want to prevent assignments to all properties on an object. Type‐

Script provides a generic utility type, Readonly<T>, that does just that:

```
Item 14: Use readonly to Avoid Errors Associated with Mutation | 67
```

```
interface FullyMutableName {
first: string ;
last: string ;
}
type FullyImmutableName = Readonly<FullyMutableName>;
// ^? type FullyImmutableName = {
// readonly first: string;
// readonly last: string;
// }
```
(Focus on the readonlys: the change from interface to type isn’t important here.)

If a function takes an object as a parameter and doesn’t modify it, it’s a good idea to

wrap that type in Readonly to advertise this to callers and enforce it in the

implementation.

There are two important caveats to know about with the readonly property modifier

and Readonly<T>. The first is that they are shallow. Just like a const declaration, a

readonly property cannot be reassigned but it can be mutated:

```
interface Outer {
inner: {
x: number ;
}
}
const obj: Readonly<Outer> = { inner: { x: 0 }};
obj.inner = { x: 1 };
// ~~~~~ Cannot assign to 'inner' because it is a read-only property
obj.inner.x = 1; // OK
```
You can create a type alias and then inspect it in your editor to see exactly what’s hap‐

pening:

```
type T = Readonly<Outer>;
// ^? type T = {
// readonly inner: {
// x: number;
// };
// }
```
The important thing to note is that there’s a readonly modifier on inner but not on

x. There is no built-in support for deep readonly types, but it is possible to write a

generic type to produce them. Getting this right is tricky, so I recommend using a

library rather than rolling your own. The DeepReadonly generic in ts-essentials is

one implementation.

The second caveat about Readonly is that it only affects properties. If you apply it to a

type with methods that mutate the underlying object, it won’t remove them:

```
const date: Readonly<Date> = new Date();
date.setFullYear(2037); // OK, but mutates date!
```
**68 | Chapter 2: TypeScript’s Type System**


If you want both a mutable and immutable version of a class, you’ll generally need to

separate them yourself. A great example of this in the standard library is the Array

and ReadonlyArray interfaces. Here’s what Array<T> looks like (in lib.es5.d.ts):

```
interface Array<T> {
length: number ;
// (non-mutating methods)
toString(): string ;
join(separator?: string ): string ;
// ...
// (mutating methods)
pop(): T | undefined ;
shift(): T | undefined ;
// ...
[n: number ]: T;
}
```
And here’s the corresponding immutable version, ReadonlyArray<T>:

```
interface ReadonlyArray<T> {
readonly length: number ;
// (non-mutating methods)
toString(): string ;
join(separator?: string ): string ;
// ...
readonly [n: number ]: T;
}
```
The key differences are that the mutating methods (such as pop and shift) aren’t

defined on ReadonlyArray, and the two properties, length and the index type ([n:

number]: T), have readonly modifiers. This prevents resizing the array and assigning

to elements in the array. (number as an index type isn’t something you should use in

your own code; see Item 17.)

Since both Array<T> and ReadonlyArray<T> are so common, they get a special syn‐

tax: T[] and readonly T[]. Because T[] is strictly more capable than readonly T[],

it follows that T[] is a subtype of readonly T[]. (It’s easy to get this backwards—

remember Item 7!)

So you can assign a mutable array to a readonly array, but not vice versa:

```
const a: number [] = [1, 2, 3];
const b: readonly number [] = a;
const c: number [] = b;
// ~ Type 'readonly number[]' is 'readonly' and cannot be
// assigned to the mutable type 'number[]'
```
This makes sense: the readonly modifier wouldn’t be much use if you could get rid of

it without even a type assertion.

```
Item 14: Use readonly to Avoid Errors Associated with Mutation | 69
```

Now we have the tools we need to improve the printTriangles and arraySum func‐

tions. If printTriangles wants to prevent arraySum from mutating the nums array, it

can pass it a readonly view:

```
function printTriangles(n: number ) {
const nums = [];
for ( let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
nums.push(i);
console.log(arraySum(nums as readonly number []));
// ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
// The type 'readonly number[]' is 'readonly' and cannot be
// assigned to the mutable type 'number[]'.
}
}
```
We can’t declare that nums is readonly number[] since we still need to mutate it. We

just want to make sure that arraySum doesn’t. Since it’s declared to take a mutable

array, we get a type error.

You can fix this by making it take a readonly array instead. Now we get a type error

in arraySum:

```
function arraySum(arr: readonly number []) {
let sum = 0, num;
while ((num = arr.pop()) !== undefined ) {
// ~~~ 'pop' does not exist on type 'readonly number[]'
sum += num;
}
return sum;
}
```
This error message makes sense in light of the Array and ReadonlyArray interfaces

that we saw earlier. pop exists on Array but not ReadonlyArray.

We can fix the type error in arraySum by not mutating the array:

```
function arraySum(arr: readonly number []) {
let sum = 0;
for ( const num of arr) {
sum += num;
}
return sum;
}
```
Now printTriangles does what you expect:

```
> printTriangles(5)
0
1
3
6
10
```
**70 | Chapter 2: TypeScript’s Type System**


When you give a parameter a read-only type (either readonly for an array or

Readonly for an object type), a few things happen:

- TypeScript checks that the parameter isn’t mutated in the function body.
- You advertise to callers that your function doesn’t mutate the parameter.
- Callers may pass your function a readonly array or Readonly object.

If your function does not mutate its parameters, then you should declare them

readonly. There’s relatively little downside: users will be able to call them with a

broader set of types (Item 30), and inadvertent mutations will be caught.

(Note that you can still reassign readonly parameters. They’re like variables declared

with let rather than const. Reassignment isn’t visible to the function’s caller, whereas

mutation is.)

One problem is that you may need to call functions that haven’t marked their param‐

eters readonly. If these functions don’t mutate their parameters and are in your con‐

trol, make them readonly! readonly tends to be contagious: once you mark one

function with readonly, you’ll also need to mark many of the functions that it calls.

This is a good thing since it leads to clearer contracts and better type safety. But if

you’re calling a function in another library, you may not be able to change its type

declarations. In this case, you’ll have to either resort to a type assertion (param as

number[]) or patch the type declarations (Item 71).

There is often an assumption in JavaScript (and TypeScript) that functions don’t

mutate their parameters unless explicitly noted. But as we’ll see time and again in this

book (particularly Items 31 and 33 ), these sorts of implicit understandings can lead to

trouble with type checking. Better to make them explicit, both for human readers and

for tsc.

**Things to Remember**

- If your function does not modify its parameters, declare them readonly (arrays)
    or Readonly (object types). This makes the function’s contract clearer and pre‐
    vents inadvertent mutations in its implementation.
- Understand that readonly and Readonly are shallow, and that Readonly only
    affects properties, not methods.
- Use readonly to prevent errors with mutation and to find the places in your code
    where mutations occur.
- Understand the difference between const and readonly: the former prevents
    reassignment, the latter prevents mutation.

### Item 15: Use Type Operations and Generic Types to Avoid Repeating Yourself

This script prints the dimensions, surface areas, and volumes of a few cylinders:

```
console.log(
'Cylinder r=1 × h=1',
'Surface area:', 6.283185 * 1 * 1 + 6.283185 * 1 * 1,
'Volume:', 3.14159 * 1 * 1 * 1
);
console.log(
'Cylinder r=1 × h=2',
'Surface area:', 6.283185 * 1 * 1 + 6.283185 * 2 * 1,
'Volume:', 3.14159 * 1 * 2 * 1
);
console.log(
'Cylinder r=2 × h=1',
'Surface area:', 6.283185 * 2 * 1 + 6.283185 * 2 * 1,
'Volume:', 3.14159 * 2 * 2 * 1
);
```
Is this code uncomfortable to look at? It should be. It’s extremely repetitive, as though

the same line was copied and pasted, then modified. It repeats both values and con‐

stants. This has allowed an error to creep in (did you spot it?).

Much better would be to factor out some functions, a constant, and a loop:

```
type CylinderFn = (r: number , h: number ) => number ;
const surfaceArea: CylinderFn = (r, h) => 2 * Math.PI * r * (r + h);
const volume: CylinderFn = (r, h) => Math.PI * r * r * h;
```
```
for ( const [r, h] of [[1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 1]]) {
console.log(
`Cylinder r=${r} × h=${h}`,
`Surface area: ${surfaceArea(r, h)}`,
`Volume: ${volume(r, h)}`);
}
```
With the formulas written out clearly, the bug is gone (the last example had an r*h

for the surface area instead of an r*r). This is the DRY principle: don’t repeat your‐

self. It’s the closest thing to universal advice that you’ll find in software development.

Yet developers who assiduously avoid repetition in code may not think twice about it

in types:

```
interface Person {
firstName: string ;
lastName: string ;
}
```
```
interface PersonWithBirthDate {
firstName: string ;
```
**72 | Chapter 2: TypeScript’s Type System**


```
lastName: string ;
birth: Date;
}
```
Duplication in types has many of the same problems as duplication in code. What if

you decide to add an optional middleName field to Person? Now Person and Person

WithBirthDate have diverged.

One reason that duplication is more common in types is that the mechanisms for fac‐

toring out shared patterns are less familiar than they are with code: what’s the type

system equivalent of factoring out a helper function? By learning how to map

between types, you can bring the benefits of DRY to your type definitions.

The simplest way to reduce repetition is by naming your types. Rather than writing a

distance function this way:

```
function distance(a: {x: number , y: number }, b: {x: number , y: number }) {
return Math.sqrt((a.x - b.x) ** 2 + (a.y - b.y) ** 2);
}
```
create a name for the type and use it:

```
interface Point2D {
x: number ;
y: number ;
}
function distance(a: Point2D, b: Point2D) { /* ... */ }
```
This is the type system equivalent of factoring out a constant instead of writing it

repeatedly. Duplicated types aren’t always so easy to spot. Sometimes they can be

obscured by syntax.

If several functions share the same type signature, for instance:

```
function get(url: string , opts: Options): Promise<Response> { /* ... */ }
function post(url: string , opts: Options): Promise<Response> { /* ... */ }
```
then you can follow the advice of Item 12 and factor out a named type for this

signature:

```
type HTTPFunction = (url: string , opts: Options) => Promise<Response>;
const get: HTTPFunction = (url, opts) => { /* ... */ };
const post: HTTPFunction = (url, opts) => { /* ... */ };
```
The CylinderFn type from the beginning of this item is another example of this.

What about the Person / PersonWithBirthDate example? You can eliminate the repe‐

tition by making one interface extend the other:

```
interface Person {
firstName: string ;
lastName: string ;
}
```
```
Item 15: Use Type Operations and Generic Types to Avoid Repeating Yourself | 73
```

```
interface PersonWithBirthDate extends Person {
birth: Date;
}
```
Now you only need to write the additional fields. If the two interfaces share a subset

of their fields, then you can factor out a base interface with just these common fields.

For example, rather than defining independent types for birds and mammals:

```
interface Bird {
wingspanCm: number ;
weightGrams: number ;
color: string ;
isNocturnal: boolean ;
}
interface Mammal {
weightGrams: number ;
color: string ;
isNocturnal: boolean ;
eatsGardenPlants: boolean ;
}
```
you might factor out a Vertebrate class with some of the shared properties:

```
interface Vertebrate {
weightGrams: number ;
color: string ;
isNocturnal: boolean ;
}
interface Bird extends Vertebrate {
wingspanCm: number ;
}
interface Mammal extends Vertebrate {
eatsGardenPlants: boolean ;
}
```
Now if you change the base properties or add TSDoc comments to them (Item 68),

the changes will be reflected in both Bird and Mammal. Continuing the analogy with

code duplication, this is akin to writing PI and 2*PI instead of 3.141593 and

6.283185.

You can also use the intersection operator (&) to extend an existing type, though this

is somewhat less common:

```
type PersonWithBirthDate = Person & { birth: Date };
```
This technique is most useful when you want to add some additional properties to a

union type (which you cannot extend). For more on this, see Item 13.

You can also go the other direction. What if you have a type, State, which represents

the state of an entire application, and another, TopNavState, which represents just a

part?

**74 | Chapter 2: TypeScript’s Type System**


```
interface State {
userId: string ;
pageTitle: string ;
recentFiles: string [];
pageContents: string ;
}
interface TopNavState {
userId: string ;
pageTitle: string ;
recentFiles: string [];
// omits pageContents
}
```
Rather than building up State by extending TopNavState, you’d like to define TopNav

State as a subset of the fields in State. This way you can keep a single interface

defining the state for the entire app.

You can remove duplication in the types of the properties by indexing into State:

```
interface TopNavState {
userId: State['userId'];
pageTitle: State['pageTitle'];
recentFiles: State['recentFiles'];
};
```
While it’s longer, this is progress: a change in the type of pageTitle in State will get

reflected in TopNavState. But it’s still repetitive. You can do better with a mapped

type:

```
type TopNavState = {
[K in 'userId' | 'pageTitle' | 'recentFiles']: State[K]
};
```
Mousing over TopNavState shows that this definition is, in fact, exactly the same as

the previous one (see Figure 2-12).

Figure 2-12. Showing the expanded version of a mapped type in your text editor. This is

the same as the initial definition, but with less duplication.

Mapped types are the type system equivalent of looping over the fields in an array.

This particular pattern is so common that it’s part of the standard library, where it’s

called Pick:

```
Item 15: Use Type Operations and Generic Types to Avoid Repeating Yourself | 75
```

```
type Pick<T, K> = { [k in K]: T[k] };
```
(This definition isn’t quite complete. We’ll revisit it in Item 50.) You use it like this:

```
type TopNavState = Pick<State, 'userId' | 'pageTitle' | 'recentFiles'>;
```
Pick is an example of a generic type. Continuing the analogy to removing code dupli‐

cation, using Pick is the equivalent of calling a function. Pick takes two types, T and

K, and returns a third, much as a function might take two values and return a third.

Chapter 6 is all about programming at the type level, and Item 50 explores the idea of

generic types as “functions on types.”

Another form of duplication can arise with tagged unions. What if you want a type

for just the tag?

```
interface SaveAction {
type : 'save';
// ...
}
interface LoadAction {
type : 'load';
// ...
}
type Action = SaveAction | LoadAction;
type ActionType = 'save' | 'load'; // Repeated types!
```
You can define ActionType without repeating yourself by indexing into the Action

union:

```
type ActionType = Action['type'];
// ^? type ActionType = "save" | "load"
```
As you add more types to the Action union, ActionType will incorporate them auto‐

matically. This type is distinct from what you’d get using Pick, which would give you

an interface with a type property:

```
type ActionRecord = Pick<Action, 'type'>;
// ^? type ActionRecord = { type: "save" | "load"; }
```
If you’re defining a class that can be initialized and later updated, the type for the

parameter to the update method might optionally include most of the same parame‐

ters as the constructor:

```
interface Options {
width: number ;
height: number ;
color: string ;
label: string ;
}
interface OptionsUpdate {
width?: number ;
height?: number ;
color?: string ;
```
**76 | Chapter 2: TypeScript’s Type System**


```
label?: string ;
}
class UIWidget {
constructor (init: Options) { /* ... */ }
update(options: OptionsUpdate) { /* ... */ }
}
```
You can construct OptionsUpdate from Options using a mapped type and keyof:

```
type OptionsUpdate = {[k in keyof Options]?: Options[k]};
```
keyof takes a type and gives you a union of the types of its keys:

```
type OptionsKeys = keyof Options;
// ^? type OptionsKeys = keyof Options
// (equivalent to "width" | "height" | "color" | "label")
```
The mapped type ([k in keyof Options]) iterates over these and looks up the cor‐

responding value type in Options. The? makes each property optional. This pattern

is also very common and is included in the standard library as Partial:

```
class UIWidget {
constructor (init: Options) { /* ... */ }
update(options: Partial<Options>) { /* ... */ }
}
```
Mapped types have a few other tricks up their sleeve. You can include an as clause in

them to rename the keys. There are many uses for this, but one is to invert the keys

and values in a mapping:

```
interface ShortToLong {
q: 'search';
n: 'numberOfResults';
}
type LongToShort = { [k in keyof ShortToLong as ShortToLong[k]]: k };
// ^? type LongToShort = { search: "q"; numberOfResults: "n"; }
```
This works particularly well with template literal types, which let you manipulate

string literal types at the type level. These are the subject of Item 54.

If the index clause in your mapped type is of the form K in keyof T or a few variants

on it, then TypeScript treats it as a “homomorphic” mapped type. This means that

modifiers (like readonly and? for optional) and documentation are transferred over

to the new type:

```
interface Customer {
/** How the customer would like to be addressed. */
title?: string ;
/** Complete name as entered in the system. */
readonly name: string ;
}
```
```
type PickTitle = Pick<Customer, 'title'>;
```
```
Item 15: Use Type Operations and Generic Types to Avoid Repeating Yourself | 77
```

```
// ^? type PickTitle = { title?: string; }
type PickName = Pick<Customer, 'name'>;
// ^? type PickName = { readonly name: string; }
type ManualName = { [K in 'name']: Customer[K]; };
// ^? type ManualName = { name: string; }
```
In this case, Pick is a homomorphic mapped type and preserves the optional and

readonly modifiers. The ManualName mapped type does not use a keyof expression,

so it is not homomorphic and it does not transfer modifiers. If you define a value

using one of the homomorphic types, you’ll see that the documentation has been

transferred over as well (Figure 2-13).

Figure 2-13. The TSDoc documentation has been copied over to the homomorphic map‐

ped type.

Another curious behavior of homomorphic mapped types is that they allow primitive

(nonobject) types to pass through unmodified:

```
type PartialNumber = Partial< number >;
// ^? type PartialNumber = number
```
This looks a bit odd, but it can be convenient when you’re building generic types of

your own, as we’ll see in Item 56.

As you define mapped types, think about whether they are homomorphic and

whether you would like them to be.

You may also find yourself wanting to define a type that matches the shape of a value:

```
const INIT_OPTIONS = {
width: 640,
height: 480,
color: '#00FF00',
label: 'VGA',
};
interface Options {
width: number ;
height: number ;
color: string ;
label: string ;
}
```
**78 | Chapter 2: TypeScript’s Type System**


You can do so with typeof:

```
type Options = typeof INIT_OPTIONS;
```
This intentionally looks like JavaScript’s runtime typeof operator, but it operates at

the level of TypeScript types and is much more precise. For more on typeof, see Item

8. Be careful about deriving types from values, however. It’s typically better to define

types first and declare that values are assignable to them. This makes your types more

explicit and less subject to the vagaries of widening (Item 20).

The canonical use case for typeof is if you have a single value that you’d like to be the

source of truth for a type (perhaps it’s some kind of schema or API specification). By

making the value the source of truth, you avoid duplication in defining the type.

Similarly, you may want to create a named type for the inferred return value of a

function or method:

```
function getUserInfo(userId: string ) {
// ...
return {
userId,
name,
age,
height,
weight,
favoriteColor,
};
}
// Return type inferred as { userId: string; name: string; age: number, ... }
```
Doing this directly requires conditional types (see Item 52). But, as we’ve seen before,

the standard library defines generic types for common patterns like this one. In this

case the ReturnType generic does exactly what you want:

```
type UserInfo = ReturnType< typeof getUserInfo>;
```
Note that ReturnType operates on typeof getUserInfo, the function’s type, rather

than getUserInfo, the function’s value. As with typeof, use this technique judi‐

ciously. Don’t get mixed up about your source of truth.

As you factor out repetition in your types, don’t go overboard. Just because two type

declarations share the same characters in source code doesn’t necessarily mean they’re

the same thing. For example, these two types share some common properties:

```
interface Product {
id: number ;
name: string ;
priceDollars: number ;
}
interface Customer {
id: number ;
```
```
Item 15: Use Type Operations and Generic Types to Avoid Repeating Yourself | 79
```

```
2 Sandi Metz, “All the Little Things”, RailsConf 2014.
```
```
name: string ;
address: string ;
}
```
But this wouldn’t be a wise refactor:

```
// Don't do this!
interface NamedAndIdentified {
id: number ;
name: string ;
}
interface Product extends NamedAndIdentified {
priceDollars: number ;
}
interface Customer extends NamedAndIdentified {
address: string ;
}
```
This is because while the id and name properties happen to have the same name and

type, they’re not referring to the same thing. In the future you might change one id to

be a string but not the other. Or you might split the customer name into firstName

and lastName, which wouldn’t make sense for a product. In this case, factoring out

the common base interface is a premature abstraction which may make it harder for

the two types to evolve independently in the future.

A good rule of thumb is that if it’s hard to name a type (or a function), then it may

not be a useful abstraction. In this case, NamedAndIdentified just describes the struc‐

ture of the type, not what it is. The Vertebrate type from before, on the other hand,

is meaningful on its own. Remember, “duplication is far cheaper than the wrong

abstraction.”^2

Repetition and copy/paste coding are just as bad in type space as they are in value

space. The constructs you use to avoid repetition in type space may be less familiar

than those used for program logic, but they are worth the effort to learn. Don’t repeat

yourself!

**Things to Remember**

- The DRY (don’t repeat yourself ) principle applies to types as much as it applies to
    logic.
- Name types rather than repeating them. Use extends to avoid repeating fields in
    interfaces.

**80 | Chapter 2: TypeScript’s Type System**


- Build an understanding of the tools provided by TypeScript to map between
    types. These include keyof, typeof, indexing, and mapped types.
- Generic types are the equivalent of functions for types. Use them to map between
    types instead of repeating type-level operations.
- Familiarize yourself with generic types defined in the standard library, such as
    Pick, Partial, and ReturnType.
- Avoid over-application of DRY: make sure the properties and types you’re shar‐
    ing are really the same thing.

### Item 16: Prefer More Precise Alternatives to Index Signatures

One of the best features of JavaScript is its convenient syntax for creating objects:

```
const rocket = {
name: 'Falcon 9',
variant: 'Block 5',
thrust: '7,607 kN',
};
```
Objects in JavaScript map string (or symbol) keys to values of any type. TypeScript

lets you represent flexible mappings like this by specifying an index signature on the

type:

```
type Rocket = {[property: string ]: string };
const rocket: Rocket = {
name: 'Falcon 9',
variant: 'v1.0',
thrust: '4,940 kN',
}; // OK
```
The [property: string]: string is the index signature. It specifies three things:

A name for the keys

This is purely for documentation; it is not used by the type checker in any way.

A type for the key

```
This needs to be a subtype of string | number | symbol (aka PropertyKey).
Typically it’s string or a subtype of string such as a union of string literals.
number indexes are best avoided, as you’ll see in Item 17. symbol is rare in appli‐
cation code.
```
A type for the values

This can be anything.

```
Item 16: Prefer More Precise Alternatives to Index Signatures | 81
```

While this code does type check, it has a few downsides:

- It allows any keys, including incorrect ones. Had you written Name instead of
    name, it would have still been a valid Rocket type.
- It doesn’t require any specific keys to be present. {} is also a valid Rocket.
- It cannot have distinct types for different keys. For example, we might want
    thrust to be a number rather than a string.
- TypeScript’s language services can’t help you with types like this. As you’re typing
    name:, there’s no autocomplete because the key could be anything.

In short, index signatures are not very precise. There are almost always better alterna‐

tives to them. In this case, Rocket could be an interface:

```
interface Rocket {
name: string ;
variant: string ;
thrust_kN: number ;
}
const falconHeavy: Rocket = {
name: 'Falcon Heavy',
variant: 'v1',
thrust_kN: 15200,
};
```
Now thrust_kN is a number and TypeScript will check for the presence of all required

fields. All the great language services that TypeScript provides are available: autocom‐

plete, jump to definition, and rename.

What should you use index signatures for? Historically, they were the best way to

model truly dynamic data. This might come from a CSV file, for instance, where you

have a header row and want to represent data rows as objects mapping column names

to values:

```
function parseCSV(input: string ): {[columnName: string ]: string }[] {
const lines = input.split('\n');
const [headerLine, ...rows] = lines;
const headers = headerLine.split(',');
return rows.map(rowStr => {
const row: {[columnName: string ]: string } = {};
rowStr.split(',').forEach((cell, i) => {
row[headers[i]] = cell;
});
return row;
});
}
```
There’s no way to know in advance what the column names are in such a general set‐

ting, so there’s no way to get a more precise type. If the user of parseCSV knows more

**82 | Chapter 2: TypeScript’s Type System**


about what the columns are in a particular context, they could use an assertion to get

more specific:

```
interface ProductRow {
productId: string ;
name: string ;
price: string ;
}
```
```
declare let csvData: string ;
const products = parseCSV(csvData) as unknown [] as ProductRow[];
```
Of course, there’s no guarantee that the columns at runtime will actually match your

expectation. You can guard against this possibility by changing the value type to

string|undefined or by setting the noUncheckedIndexedAccess compiler option

(see Item 48).

But a better way to model dynamic data is by using a Map type, also known as an asso‐

ciative array. Here’s how you might implement parseCSV using a Map:

```
function parseCSVMap(input: string ): Map< string , string >[] {
const lines = input.split('\n');
const [headerLine, ...rows] = lines;
const headers = headerLine.split(',');
return rows.map(rowStr => {
const row = new Map< string , string >();
rowStr.split(',').forEach((cell, i) => {
row.set(headers[i], cell);
});
return row;
});
}
```
Now the fields have to be accessed using the get method, and the result always

includes undefined as a possibility:

```
const rockets = parseCSVMap(csvData);
const superHeavy = rockets[2];
const thrust_kN = superHeavy.get('thrust_kN'); // 74,500
// ^? const thrust_kN: string | undefined
```
If you want to get an object type out of a Map, you’ll need to write some parsing code:

```
function parseRocket(map: Map< string , string >): Rocket {
const name = map.get('name');
const variant = map.get('variant');
const thrust_kN = Number(map.get('thrust_kN'));
if (!name || !variant || isNaN(thrust_kN)) {
throw new Error(`Invalid rocket: ${map}`);
}
return {name, variant, thrust_kN};
}
```
```
Item 16: Prefer More Precise Alternatives to Index Signatures | 83
```

```
const rockets = parseCSVMap(csvData).map(parseRocket);
// ^? const rockets: Rocket[]
```
While this may feel tedious, it does ensure that your data actually has the shape you

expect. This will flag errors when you load your data, rather than at some later point

when you try to use it. This pattern of doing data validation on a broad type

(Map<string, string>) to get a more specific one (Rocket) is common in Type‐

Script. Item 74 will explore more systematic ways of doing runtime type validation.

In addition to being a better model of dynamic data, Maps work around some famous

gotchas involving the prototype chain.

If your type has a limited set of possible fields, don’t model this with an index signa‐

ture. For instance, if you know your data will have keys like A, B, C, D, but you don’t

know how many of them there will be, you could model the type either with optional

fields or a union:

```
interface Row1 { [column: string ]: number } // Too broad
interface Row2 { a: number ; b?: number ; c?: number ; d?: number } // Better
type Row3 =
| { a: number ; }
| { a: number ; b: number ; }
| { a: number ; b: number ; c: number ; }
| { a: number ; b: number ; c: number ; d: number }; // Also better
```
The last form is the most precise, but it may be less convenient to work with. See Item

29 for more on crafting types to disallow invalid states.

If the problem with using an index signature is that string is too broad, then you can

use a Record. This is a generic type that gives you more flexibility in the key type. In

particular, you can pass in subsets of string:

```
type Vec3D = Record<'x' | 'y' | 'z', number >;
// ^? type Vec3D = {
// x: number;
// y: number;
// z: number;
// }
```
Record is a built-in wrapper around a mapped type (Item 15).

Finally, you can use an index type to disable excess property checking (Item 11). For

example, you might define a few known properties on a ButtonProps type but still

want to allow it to have any others:

```
declare function renderAButton(props: ButtonProps): void ;
interface ButtonProps {
title: string ;
onClick: () => void ;
}
```
**84 | Chapter 2: TypeScript’s Type System**


```
renderAButton({
title: 'Roll the dice',
onClick: () => alert(1 + Math.floor(6 * Math.random())),
theme: 'Solarized',
// ~~~~ Object literal may only specify known properties...
});
```
Adding an index signature makes this error go away:

```
interface ButtonProps {
title: string ;
onClick: () => void ;
[otherProps: string ]: unknown ;
}
```
```
renderAButton({
title: 'Roll the dice',
onClick: () => alert(1 + Math.floor(20 * Math.random())),
theme: 'Solarized', // ok
});
```
Crucially, both title and onClick still have the same types as before. Passing a

number as the title will result in a type error.

You can also constrain these additional properties to match a certain pattern. For

example, some web components allow arbitrary properties but only if they start with

"data-". You can model this using an index signature and a template literal type.

Item 54 will show you how.

In conclusion, think twice before you add an index signature to your data type. Is

there a more precise alternative available? Could you use an interface without an

index type? Could you use a Map instead? A mapped type? If nothing else, can you at

least constrain the type of the keys?

**Things to Remember**

- Understand the drawbacks of index signatures: much like any, they erode type
    safety and reduce the value of language services.
- Prefer more precise types to index signatures when possible: interfaces, Map,
    Records, mapped types, or index signatures with a constrained key space.

### Item 17: Avoid Numeric Index Signatures

JavaScript is a famously quirky language. Some of the most notorious quirks involve

implicit type coercions:

```
> "0" == 0
true
```
```
Item 17: Avoid Numeric Index Signatures | 85
```

These can usually be avoided by using === and !== instead of their more coercive

cousins.

JavaScript’s object model also has its quirks, and these are more important to under‐

stand because some of them are modeled by TypeScript’s type system. You’ve already

seen one such quirk in Item 10, which discussed object wrapper types. This item dis‐

cusses another.

What is an object? In JavaScript it’s a collection of key/value pairs. The keys are usu‐

ally strings (in ES2015 and later they can also be symbols). The values can be

anything.

This is more restrictive than what you find in many other languages. JavaScript does

not have a notion of “hashable” objects like you find in Python or Java. If you try to

use a more complex object as a key, it is converted into a string by calling its toString

method:

```
> x = {}
{}
> x[[1, 2, 3]] = 2
2
> x
{ '1,2,3': 2 }
```
In particular, numbers cannot be used as keys. If you try to use a number as a prop‐

erty name, the JavaScript runtime will convert it to a string:

```
> { 1: 2, 3: 4}
{ '1': 2, '3': 4 }
```
So what are arrays, then? They are certainly objects:

```
> typeof []
'object'
```
And yet it’s quite normal to use numeric indices with them:

```
> x = [1, 2, 3]
[ 1, 2, 3 ]
> x[0]
1
```
Are these being converted into strings? In one of the oddest quirks of all, the answer

is “yes.” You can also access the elements of an array using string keys:

```
> x['1']
2
```
If you use Object.keys to list the keys of an array, you get strings back:

```
> Object.keys(x)
[ '0', '1', '2' ]
```
**86 | Chapter 2: TypeScript’s Type System**


TypeScript models this by allowing numeric keys and distinguishing between these

and strings. If you dig into the type declarations for Array ( Item 6), you’ll find this in

lib.es5.d.ts:

```
interface Array<T> {
// ...
[n: number ]: T;
}
```
This is purely a fiction—string keys are accepted at runtime as the ECMAScript stan‐

dard dictates that they must—but it is a helpful one that can catch mistakes:

```
const xs = [1, 2, 3];
const x0 = xs[0]; // OK
const x1 = xs['1']; // stringified numeric constants are also OK
```
```
const inputEl = document.getElementsByTagName('input')[0];
const xN = xs[inputEl.value];
// ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Index expression is not of type 'number'.
```
In this case, inputEl.valueAsNumber would be more appropriate and would fix the

type error.

While the fiction of numeric keys is helpful, it’s important to remember that it is just

a fiction. Like all aspects of TypeScript’s type system, it is erased at runtime (Item 3).

This means that constructs like Object.keys still return strings:

```
const keys = Object.keys(xs);
// ^? const keys: string[]
```
The pattern here is that a number index signature means that what you put in gener‐

ally has to be a number, but what you get out is a string.

If this sounds confusing, it’s because it is! As a general rule, there’s not much reason to

use number as the index signature of a type. If you want to specify something that will

be indexed using numbers, you probably want to use an Array or tuple type instead.

Using number as an index type can create the misconception that numeric properties

are a real thing in JavaScript, either for yourself or for readers of your code.

If you object to accepting an Array type because they have many other properties

(from their prototype) that you might not use, such as push and concat, then that’s

good—you’re thinking structurally! (If you need a refresher on this, refer to Item 4.)

If you truly want to accept tuples of any length or any array-like construct, TypeScript

has an ArrayLike type you can use:

```
function checkedAccess<T>(xs: ArrayLike<T>, i: number ): T {
if (i >= 0 && i < xs.length) {
return xs[i];
}
throw new Error(`Attempt to access ${i} which is past end of array.`)
}
```
```
Item 17: Avoid Numeric Index Signatures | 87
```

(TypeScript also has a noUncheckedIndexedAccess option you can set for safe array

access. See Item 48.)

ArrayLike has just a length and numeric index signature. As the name implies, this

allows array-like structures such as a NodeList to be passed in. In the rare cases that

this is what you want, you should use it instead of a normal array. But remember that

the keys are still really strings!

```
const tupleLike: ArrayLike< string > = {
'0': 'A',
'1': 'B',
length: 2,
}; // OK
```
If you just need something you can iterate over, you can use the Iterable type

instead, which allows you to pass generator expressions to your function (see Item

30 ).

Object keys in JavaScript (and TypeScript) are either strings or symbols. Numeric

index types are best thought of as a concession to make the Array type convenient to

use in TypeScript. But remember that numeric indices aren’t real. Avoid using them

in your own types.

**Things to Remember**

- Understand that arrays are objects, so their keys are strings, not numbers. number
    as an index signature is a purely TypeScript construct designed to help catch
    bugs.
- Prefer Array, tuple, ArrayLike, or Iterable types to using number in an index
    signature yourself.

**88 | Chapter 2: TypeScript’s Type System**


**CHAPTER 3**

### Type Inference and Control Flow Analysis

For programming languages used in industry, “statically typed” and “explicitly typed”

have traditionally been synonymous. C, C++, Java: they all made you write out your

types. But academic languages never conflated these two things: languages like ML

and Haskell have long had sophisticated type inference systems, and this has begun to

work its way into industry languages. C++ has added auto, and Java has added var.

Newer languages like Rust and Swift have had type inference from the start.

TypeScript makes extensive use of type inference. Used well, this can dramatically

reduce the number of type annotations your code requires to get full type safety. One

of the easiest ways to tell a TypeScript beginner from a more experienced developer is

by the number of type annotations. An experienced TypeScript developer will use rel‐

atively few annotations (but use them to great effect), while a beginner may drown

their code in redundant type annotations.

In most languages, a variable has a type and it never changes. TypeScript is a bit dif‐

ferent. A variable has a type at a location in your code. The process by which its type

changes due to surrounding code is known as control flow analysis.

This chapter teaches you how to think about type inference and control flow analysis,

shows you some of the problems that can arise with them, and tells you how to fix

them. After reading it, you should have a good understanding of how TypeScript

infers types, when you still need to write explicit type annotations, and when it’s still a

good idea to write type annotations even when a type can be inferred.

##### 89


### Item 18: Avoid Cluttering Your Code with Inferable Types

The first thing that many new TypeScript developers do when they convert a code‐

base from JavaScript is fill it with type annotations. TypeScript is about types, after all!

But in TypeScript, many annotations are unnecessary. Declaring types for all your

variables is counterproductive and is considered poor style.

Don’t write:

```
let x: number = 12;
```
Instead, just write:

```
let x = 12;
```
If you mouse over x in your editor, you’ll see that its type has been inferred as number

(as shown in Figure 3-1).

Figure 3-1. A text editor showing that the inferred type of _x_ is number.

The explicit type annotation is redundant. Writing it just adds noise. If you’re unsure

of the type, you can check it in your editor.

TypeScript will also infer the types of more complex objects. Instead of:

```
const person: {
name: string ;
born: {
where: string ;
when: string ;
};
died: {
where: string ;
when: string ;
}
} = {
name: 'Sojourner Truth',
born: {
where: 'Swartekill, NY',
when: 'c.1797',
},
died: {
where: 'Battle Creek, MI',
when: 'Nov. 26, 1883'
}
};
```
**90 | Chapter 3: Type Inference and Control Flow Analysis**


you can just write:

```
const person = {
name: 'Sojourner Truth',
born: {
where: 'Swartekill, NY',
when: 'c.1797',
},
died: {
where: 'Battle Creek, MI',
when: 'Nov. 26, 1883'
}
};
```
Again, the types are exactly the same. Writing the type in addition to the value just

adds noise here. (Item 20 will explain how TypeScript infers types for object literals.)

What’s true for objects is also true for arrays. TypeScript has no trouble figuring out

the return type of this function based on its inputs and operations:

```
function square(nums: number []) {
return nums.map(x => x * x);
}
const squares = square([1, 2, 3, 4]);
// ^? const squares: number[]
```
TypeScript may infer something more precise than what you expected. This is gener‐

ally a good thing. For example:

```
const axis1: string = 'x';
// ^? const axis1: string
const axis2 = 'y';
// ^? const axis2: "y"
```
"y" is a more precise type for the axis2 variable. The explicit string annotation on

axis1 adds noise and reduces type safety.

Allowing types to be inferred can also facilitate refactoring. Say you have a Product

type and a function to log it:

```
interface Product {
id: number ;
name: string ;
price: number ;
}
```
```
function logProduct(product: Product) {
const id: number = product.id;
const name: string = product.name;
const price: number = product.price;
console.log(id, name, price);
}
```
```
Item 18: Avoid Cluttering Your Code with Inferable Types | 91
```

At some point you learn that product IDs might have letters in them in addition to

numbers. So you change the type of id in Product:

```
interface Product {
id: string ;
name: string ;
price: number ;
}
```
Because you included explicit annotations on all the variables in logProduct, this

produces an error:

```
function logProduct(product: Product) {
const id: number = product.id;
// ~~ Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'
const name: string = product.name;
const price: number = product.price;
console.log(id, name, price);
}
```
Had you left off all the annotations in the logProduct function body, the code would

have passed the type checker without modification (and worked correctly at runtime,

too).

Here’s a better implementation of logProduct that allows the types of all local vari‐

ables to be inferred (it also switches to destructuring assignment):

```
function logProduct(product: Product) {
const {id, name, price} = product;
console.log(id, name, price);
}
```
The corresponding version with explicit type annotations is repetitive and cluttered:

```
function logProduct(product: Product) {
const {id, name, price}: {id: string ; name: string ; price: number } = product;
console.log(id, name, price);
}
```
You can’t put type annotations directly inside the destructuring because, as Item 8

explained, they would be interpreted as renaming directives in value space. Destruc‐

turing assignment is a great way to make your code more concise. It encourages con‐

sistent naming and it works much better with inferred types.

Explicit type annotations are still required in some situations where TypeScript

doesn’t have enough context to determine a type on its own. You have seen one of

these before: function parameters.

Some languages will infer types for parameters based on their eventual usage, but

TypeScript does not. In TypeScript, a variable’s type is generally determined when it is

first introduced. (Item 25 discusses an important exception to this rule.)

**92 | Chapter 3: Type Inference and Control Flow Analysis**


Ideal TypeScript code includes type annotations for function/method signatures but

not for the local variables created in their bodies. This keeps noise to a minimum and

lets readers focus on the implementation logic.

There are some situations where you can leave the type annotations off of function

parameters, too. When there’s a default value, for example:

```
function parseNumber(str: string , base=10) {
// ^? (parameter) base: number
// ...
}
```
Here the type of base is inferred as number because of the default value of 10.

Parameter types can usually be inferred when the function is used as a callback for a

library with type declarations. The declarations on request and response in this

example using the express HTTP server library are not required:

```
// Don't do this:
app.get('/health', (request: express.Request, response: express.Response) => {
response.send('OK');
});
```
```
// Do this:
app.get('/health', (request, response) => {
// ^? (parameter) request: Request<...>
response.send('OK');
// ^? (parameter) response: Response<...>
});
```
Item 24 has more to say about how context is used in type inference.

There are a few situations where you may still want to specify a type even where it can

be inferred.

One is when you define an object literal:

```
const elmo: Product = {
name: 'Tickle Me Elmo',
id: '048188 627152',
price: 28.99,
};
```
When you specify a type on a definition like this, you enable excess property check‐

ing (Item 11). This can help catch errors, particularly for types with optional fields.

You also increase the odds that an error will be reported in the right place. If you

leave off the annotation, a mistake in the object’s definition will result in a type error

where it’s used, rather than where it’s defined:

```
const furby = {
name: 'Furby',
id: 630509430963,
```
```
Item 18: Avoid Cluttering Your Code with Inferable Types | 93
```

```
price: 35,
};
logProduct(furby);
// ~~~~~ Argument ... is not assignable to parameter of type 'Product'
// Types of property 'id' are incompatible
// Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'
```
In a larger codebase, this type error could appear in a different file with no clear con‐

nection to the object definition. With an annotation, you get a more concise error in

the exact place where the mistake was made:

```
const furby: Product = {
name: 'Furby',
id: 630509430963,
// ~~ Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'
price: 35,
};
logProduct(furby);
```
Similar considerations apply to a function’s return type. You may still want to anno‐

tate this even when it can be inferred to ensure that implementation errors don’t leak

out into uses of the function. This is particularly important for exported functions

that are part of a public API.

Say you have a function that retrieves a stock quote:

```
function getQuote(ticker: string ) {
return fetch(`https://quotes.example.com/?q=${ticker}`)
.then(response => response.json());
}
```
You decide to add a cache to avoid duplicating network requests:

```
const cache: {[ticker: string ]: number } = {};
function getQuote(ticker: string ) {
if (ticker in cache) {
return cache[ticker];
}
return fetch(`https://quotes.example.com/?q=${ticker}`)
.then(response => response.json())
.then(quote => {
cache[ticker] = quote;
return quote as number ;
});
}
```
There’s a mistake in this implementation, which you can see if you look at the infer‐

red return type for getQuote:

```
getQuote;
// ^? function getQuote(ticker: string): number | Promise<number>
```
**94 | Chapter 3: Type Inference and Control Flow Analysis**


You should really be returning Promise.resolve(cache[ticker]) so that getQuote

always returns a Promise. The mistake will most likely produce an error...but in the

code that calls getQuote, rather than in getQuote itself:

```
getQuote('MSFT').then(considerBuying);
// ~~~~ Property 'then' does not exist on type
// 'number | Promise<number>'
```
Had you annotated the intended return type (Promise<number>), the error would

have been reported in the correct place:

```
const cache: {[ticker: string ]: number } = {};
function getQuote(ticker: string ): Promise< number > {
if (ticker in cache) {
return cache[ticker];
// ~~~ Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'Promise<number>'
}
// ...
}
```
When you annotate the return type, it keeps implementation errors from manifesting

as errors in user code. This is a particularly good idea for functions like getQuote that

have multiple return statements. If you want TypeScript to check that all the returns

return the same type, you’ll need to provide a type annotation to tell it your intent.

(Item 27 explains how async functions are an effective way to avoid this particular

mistake.)

Writing out the return type may also help you think more clearly about your func‐

tion: you should know what its input and output types are before you implement it.

While the implementation may shift around a bit, the function’s contract (its type sig‐

nature) generally should not. This is similar in spirit to test-driven development

(TDD), in which you write the tests that exercise a function before you implement it.

Writing the full type signature first helps get you the function you want, rather than

the one the implementation makes expedient.

Another reason to annotate return types is if you want to use a named type. You

might choose not to write a return type for this function, for example:

```
interface Vector2D { x: number ; y: number ; }
function add(a: Vector2D, b: Vector2D) {
return { x: a.x + b.x , y: a.y + b.y };
}
```
TypeScript infers the return type as { x: number; y: number; }. This is compatible

with Vector2D, but it may be surprising to users of your code when they see Vector2D

as a type of the input and not of the output (Figure 3-2).

```
Item 18: Avoid Cluttering Your Code with Inferable Types | 95
```

Figure 3-2. The parameters to the _add_ function have named types, but the inferred

return value does not.

If you annotate the return type, the presentation is more straightforward. And if

you’ve written documentation on the type (Item 68), it will be associated with the

returned value as well. As the complexity of the inferred return type increases, it

becomes increasingly helpful to provide a name.

Finally, annotating your return types means that TypeScript has less work to do figur‐

ing them out. For large codebases, this can have an impact on compiler performance.

Item 78 has more guidance on what to do when your build gets slow.

So should you annotate return types? To reduce code and facilitate refactoring, the

default answer is “no.” But it shouldn’t take much to tip you over to “yes.”. If the func‐

tion has multiple return statements, if it’s part of a public API, or if you want to use a

named return type, then add the annotation.

If you are using a linter, the typescript-eslint rule no-inferrable-types (note the

variant spelling) can help ensure that all your type annotations are really necessary.

**Things to Remember**

- Avoid writing type annotations when TypeScript can infer the same type.
- Ideal TypeScript code has type annotations in function/method signatures but
    not on local variables in their bodies.
- Consider using explicit annotations for object literals to enable excess property
    checking and ensure errors are reported close to where they occur.
- Don’t annotate function return types unless the function has multiple returns, is
    part of a public API, or you want it to return a named type.

### Item 19: Use Different Variables for Different Types

In JavaScript, it’s no problem to reuse a variable to hold a differently typed value for a

different purpose:

```
let productId = "12-34-56";
fetchProduct(productId); // Expects a string
```
```
productId = 123456;
fetchProductBySerialNumber(productId); // Expects a number
```
**96 | Chapter 3: Type Inference and Control Flow Analysis**


In TypeScript, this results in two errors:

```
let productId = "12-34-56";
fetchProduct(productId);
```
```
productId = 123456;
// ~~~~~~ Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'
fetchProductBySerialNumber(productId);
// ~~~~~~~~~
// Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'
```
Hovering over the first productId in your editor gives a hint as to what’s going on

(see Figure 3-3).

Figure 3-3. The inferred type of _productId_ is _string_.

Based on the value "12-34-56", TypeScript has inferred productId’s type as string.

You can’t assign a number to a string, hence the error.

This leads us to a key insight about variables in TypeScript: while a variable’s value can

change, its type generally does not. The one common way a type can change is to nar‐

row (Item 22), but this involves a type getting smaller, not expanding to include new

values. Item 25 presents a notable exception to this rule, but it is an exception and not

the rule.

How can you use this idea to fix the example? For productId’s type to not change, it

must be broad enough to encompass both strings and numbers. This is the very defi‐

nition of the union type, string|number:

```
let productId: string | number = "12-34-56";
fetchProduct(productId);
```
```
productId = 123456; // OK
fetchProductBySerialNumber(productId); // OK
```
This fixes the errors. It’s interesting that TypeScript has been able to determine that id

is really a string in the first call and really a number in the second. It has narrowed

the union type based on the assignment.

While a union type does work, it may create more issues down the road. Union types

are harder to work with than simple types like string or number because you usually

have to check what they are before you do anything with them.

```
Item 19: Use Different Variables for Different Types | 97
```

The better solution is to introduce a new variable:

```
const productId = "12-34-56";
fetchProduct(productId);
```
```
const serial = 123456; // OK
fetchProductBySerialNumber(serial); // OK
```
In the previous version, the first and second productId were not semantically related

to one another. They were only related by the fact that you reused a variable. This was

confusing for the type checker and would be confusing for a human reader, too.

The version with two variables is better for a number of reasons:

- It disentangles two unrelated concepts (ID and serial number).
- It allows you to use more specific variable names.
- It improves type inference. No type annotations are needed.
- It results in simpler types (string and number literals, rather than string|
    number).
- It lets you declare the variables const rather than let. This makes them easier for
    people and the type checker to reason about.

The general theme, which will come up repeatedly in this chapter, is that mutation

makes it harder for the type checker to follow along with your code. Try to avoid

type-changing variables. If you can use different names for different concepts, it will

make your code clearer both to human readers and to the type checker. You should

have far more const than let.

This is not to be confused with “shadowed” variables, as in this example:

```
const productId = "12-34-56";
fetchProduct(productId);
```
##### {

```
const productId = 123456; // OK
fetchProductBySerialNumber(productId); // OK
}
```
While these two productIds share a name, they are actually two distinct variables

with no relationship to one another. It’s fine for them to have different types. While

TypeScript is not confused by this, your human readers might be. In general it’s better

to use different names for different concepts. Many teams choose to disallow this sort

of shadowing via linter rules such as eslint’s no-shadow.

This item focused on scalar values, but similar considerations apply to objects. For

more on that, see Item 21.

**98 | Chapter 3: Type Inference and Control Flow Analysis**


**Things to Remember**

- While a variable’s value can change, its type generally does not.
- To avoid confusion, both for human readers and for the type checker, avoid reus‐
    ing variables for differently typed values.

### Item 20: Understand How a Variable Gets Its Type

As Item 7 explained, at runtime every variable has a single value. But at static analysis

time, when TypeScript is checking your code, a variable has a set of possible values,

namely, its type. When you initialize a variable with a constant but don’t provide a

type, the type checker needs to decide on one. In other words, it needs to decide on a

set of possible values from the single value that you specified. In TypeScript, this pro‐

cess is known as widening. Understanding it will help you make sense of errors and

make more effective use of type annotations.

Suppose you’re writing a library to work with vectors. You write out a type for a 3D

vector and a function to get the value of any of its components:

```
interface Vector3 { x: number ; y: number ; z: number ; }
function getComponent(vector: Vector3, axis: 'x' | 'y' | 'z') {
return vector[axis];
}
```
But when you try to use it, TypeScript flags an error:

```
let x = 'x';
let vec = {x: 10, y: 20, z: 30};
getComponent(vec, x);
// ~ Argument of type 'string' is not assignable
// to parameter of type '"x" | "y" | "z"'
```
This code runs fine, so why the error?

The issue is that x’s type is inferred as string, whereas the getComponent function

expected a more specific type for its second argument. This is widening at work, and

here it has led to a type error.

Widening is ambiguous in the sense that there are many possible types for any given

value. In this statement, for example:

```
const mixed = ['x', 1];
```
what should the type of mixed be? Here are a few possibilities:

- ('x' | 1)[]
- ['x', 1]
- [string, number]

```
Item 20: Understand How a Variable Gets Its Type | 99
```

- readonly [string, number]
- (string|number)[]
- readonly (string|number)[]
- [any, any]
- any[]

Without more context, TypeScript has no way to know which one is “right.” It has to

guess at your intent. (In this case, it guesses (string|number)[].) And smart as it is,

TypeScript can’t read your mind. It won’t get this right 100% of the time. The result is

inadvertent errors like the one we just saw.

In the initial example, the type of x is inferred as string because TypeScript chooses

to allow code like this:

```
let x = 'x';
x = 'a';
x = 'Four score and seven years ago...';
```
But it would also be valid JavaScript to write:

```
let x = 'x';
x = /x|y|z/;
x = ['x', 'y', 'z'];
```
In inferring the type of x as string, TypeScript attempts to strike a balance between

specificity and flexibility. A variable’s type won’t change to something completely dif‐

ferent after it’s declared (Item 19), so string makes more sense than string|RegExp

or string|string[] or any.

The general rule for primitive values assigned with let is that they expand to their

“base type”: "x" expands to string, 39 expands to number, true expands to boolean

and so on. (null and undefined are handled differently, see Item 25.)

TypeScript gives you a few ways to control the process of widening. One is const. If

you declare a variable with const instead of let, it gets a narrower type. In fact, using

const fixes the error in our original example:

```
const x = 'x';
// ^? const x: "x"
let vec = {x: 10, y: 20, z: 30};
getComponent(vec, x); // OK
```
Because x cannot be reassigned, TypeScript is able to infer a more precise type

without risk of inadvertently flagging errors on subsequent assignments. And because

the string literal type "x" is assignable to "x"|"y"|"z", the code passes the type

checker.

**100 | Chapter 3: Type Inference and Control Flow Analysis**


const isn’t a panacea, however. For objects and arrays, there is still ambiguity. The

mixed example illustrated the issue for arrays: should TypeScript infer a tuple type?

What type should it infer for the elements?

Similar issues arise with objects. This code is fine in JavaScript:

```
const obj = {
x: 1,
};
obj.x = 3;
obj.x = '3';
obj.y = 4;
obj.z = 5;
obj.name = 'Pythagoras';
```
The type of obj could be inferred anywhere along the spectrum of specificity. At the

specific end is {readonly x: 1}. More general is {x: number}. More general still

would be {[key: string]: number}, object or, most general of all, any, or unknown.

In the case of objects, TypeScript infers what it calls the “best common type.” It deter‐

mines this by treating each property as though it were assigned with let. So the type

of obj comes out as {x: number}. This lets you reassign obj.x to a different number,

but not to a string. And it prevents you from adding other properties via direct

assignment. (This is a good reason to build objects all at once, as explained in

Item 21.)

So the last four statements are errors:

```
const obj = {
x: 1,
};
obj.x = 3; // OK
obj.x = '3';
// ~ Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'
obj.y = 4;
// ~ Property 'y' does not exist on type '{ x: number; }'
obj.z = 5;
// ~ Property 'z' does not exist on type '{ x: number; }'
obj.name = 'Pythagoras';
// ~~~~ Property 'name' does not exist on type '{ x: number; }'
```
Again, TypeScript is trying to strike a balance between specificity and flexibility. It

needs to infer a specific enough type to catch errors, but not such a specific type that

it creates false positives. It does this by inferring a type of number for a property ini‐

tialized to a value like 1.

If you know better, there are a few ways to override TypeScript’s default behavior. One

is to supply an explicit type annotation:

```
const obj: { x: string | number } = { x: 1 };
// ^? const obj: { x: string | number; }
```
```
Item 20: Understand How a Variable Gets Its Type | 101
```

Another is to provide additional context to the type checker, e.g., by passing the value

as an argument to a function (Item 24).

A third way is with a const assertion. This is not to be confused with let and const,

which introduce symbols in value space. This is a purely type-level construct. Look at

the different inferred types for these variables:

```
const obj1 = { x: 1, y: 2 };
// ^? const obj1: { x: number; y: number; }
```
```
const obj2 = { x: 1 as const , y: 2 };
// ^? const obj2: { x: 1; y: number; }
```
```
const obj3 = { x: 1, y: 2 } as const ;
// ^? const obj3: { readonly x: 1; readonly y: 2; }
```
When you write as const after a value, TypeScript will infer the narrowest possible

type for it. There is no widening. For true constants, this is typically what you want.

You can also use as const with arrays to infer a tuple type:

```
const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
// ^? const arr1: number[]
const arr2 = [1, 2, 3] as const ;
// ^? const arr2: readonly [1, 2, 3]
```
Despite the similar syntax, a const assertion should not be confused with a type

assertion (as T). While type assertions are best avoided (Item 9), a const assertion

doesn’t compromise type safety and is always OK.

There’s a handy trick if you want TypeScript to infer a tuple type instead of an array

type, but still allow the type of each element in the tuple to widen to its base type /

best common type:

```
function tuple<T extends unknown []>(...elements: T) { return elements; }
```
```
const arr3 = tuple(1, 2, 3);
// ^? const arr3: [number, number, number]
const mix = tuple(4, 'five', true );
// ^? const mix: [number, string, boolean]
```
The tuple function here serves no purpose at runtime, but guides TypeScript toward

inferring the type you want. Another function that can guide inference is JavaScript’s

Object.freeze:

```
const frozenArray = Object.freeze([1, 2, 3]);
// ^? const frozenArray: readonly number[]
const frozenObj = Object.freeze({x: 1, y: 2});
// ^? const frozenObj: Readonly<{ x: 1; y: 2; }>
```
Like a const assertion, Object.freeze has introduced some readonly modifiers into

the inferred types (though it displays differently, the type of frozenObj is exactly the

**102 | Chapter 3: Type Inference and Control Flow Analysis**


same as obj3). Unlike a const assertion, the “freeze” will be enforced by your Java‐

Script runtime. But it’s a shallow freeze/readonly, whereas a const assertion is deep.

Item 14 discusses readonly and how it can help prevent mistakes.

Finally, a fourth way to control widening is the satisfies operator. This ensures that

a value, well, satisfies the requirements of a type and guides inference by preventing

TypeScript from inferring a wider type. Here’s how it works:

```
type Point = [ number , number ];
const capitals1 = { ny: [-73.7562, 42.6526], ca: [-121.4944, 38.5816] };
// ^? const capitals1: { ny: number[]; ca: number[]; }
```
```
const capitals2 = {
ny: [-73.7562, 42.6526], ca: [-121.4944, 38.5816]
} satisfies Record< string , Point>;
capitals2
// ^? const capitals2: { ny: [number, number]; ca: [number, number]; }
```
Left to its own devices, TypeScript takes the keys from the object literal and widens

the values to number[], just as it would with let. With satisfies, we prevent the val‐

ues from being widened beyond the Point type.

Compare this to what you get from an annotation using the same type:

```
const capitals3: Record< string , Point> = capitals2;
capitals3.pr; // undefined at runtime
// ^? Point
capitals2.pr;
// ~~ Property 'pr' does not exist on type '{ ny: ...; ca: ...; }'
```
The type coming from satisfies has precise keys, which helps to catch errors.

The satisfies operator will report an error if part of the object isn’t assignable to the

type:

```
const capitalsBad = {
ny: [-73.7562, 42.6526, 148],
// ~~ Type '[number, number, number]' is not assignable to type 'Point'.
ca: [-121.4944, 38.5816, 26],
// ~~ Type '[number, number, number]' is not assignable to type 'Point'.
} satisfies Record< string , Point>;
```
This is an improvement over a const assertion because it will report the error where

you define the object, rather than where you use it.

If you’re getting incorrect errors that you think are due to widening, consider chang‐

ing let to const, adding some explicit type annotations, using a helper function like

tuple or Object.freeze, or using a const assertion or a satisfies clause. As always,

inspecting types in your editor is the key to building an intuition for how this works

(see Item 6).

```
Item 20: Understand How a Variable Gets Its Type | 103
```

**Things to Remember**

- Understand how TypeScript infers a type from a literal by widening it.
- Familiarize yourself with the ways you can affect this behavior: const, type anno‐
    tations, context, helper functions, as const, and satisfies.

### Item 21: Create Objects All at Once

As Item 19 explained, while a variable’s value may change, its type in TypeScript gen‐

erally does not. This makes some JavaScript patterns easier to model in TypeScript

than others. In particular, it means that you should prefer creating objects all at once,

rather than piece by piece.

Here’s one way to create an object representing a two-dimensional point in JavaScript:

```
const pt = {};
pt.x = 3;
pt.y = 4;
```
In TypeScript, this will produce errors on each assignment:

```
const pt = {};
// ^? const pt: {}
pt.x = 3;
// ~ Property 'x' does not exist on type '{}'
pt.y = 4;
// ~ Property 'y' does not exist on type '{}'
```
This is because the type of pt on the first line is inferred based on its value {}, and

you may only assign to known properties.

You get the opposite problem if you define a Point interface:

```
interface Point { x: number ; y: number ; }
const pt: Point = {};
// ~~ Type '{}' is missing the following properties from type 'Point': x, y
pt.x = 3;
pt.y = 4;
```
A type assertion seems to offer a solution:

```
const pt = {} as Point;
// ^? const pt: Point
pt.x = 3;
pt.y = 4; // OK
```
The problem with this pattern is that TypeScript won’t check that you’ve assigned

all the properties to pt before using it. If you dropped the assignment to pt.y,

for example, the code would still pass the type checker but might lead to NaNs or

**104 | Chapter 3: Type Inference and Control Flow Analysis**


runtime exceptions. As Item 9 explained, type assertions shouldn’t be the first tool

you reach for.

The best solution is to define the object all at once with a type declaration:

```
const pt: Point = {
x: 3,
y: 4,
};
```
If you need to build a larger object from smaller ones, avoid doing it in multiple steps:

```
const pt = {x: 3, y: 4};
const id = {name: 'Pythagoras'};
const namedPoint = {};
Object.assign(namedPoint, pt, id);
namedPoint.name;
// ~~~~ Property 'name' does not exist on type '{}'
```
You can build the larger object all at once instead using object spread syntax, ...:

```
const namedPoint = {...pt, ...id};
// ^? const namedPoint: { name: string; x: number; y: number; }
namedPoint.name; // OK
// ^? (property) name: string
```
You can also use object spread syntax to build up objects field by field in a type-safe

way. The key is to use a new variable on every update so that each gets a new type

(Item 19):

```
const pt0 = {};
const pt1 = {...pt0, x: 3};
const pt: Point = {...pt1, y: 4}; // OK
```
The type declaration on the final line ensures that we’ve added all the necessary prop‐

erties. While this is a roundabout way to build up such a simple object, it can be a

useful technique for adding properties to an object and allowing TypeScript to infer a

new type.

To conditionally add a property in a type-safe way, you can use spread syntax with {}

or any falsy value (null, undefined, false, etc.), which add no properties:

```
declare let hasMiddle: boolean ;
const firstLast = {first: 'Harry', last: 'Truman'};
const president = {...firstLast, ...(hasMiddle? {middle: 'S'} : {})};
// ^? const president: {
// middle?: string;
// first: string;
// last: string;
// }
// or: const president = {...firstLast, ...(hasMiddle && {middle: 'S'})};
```
As you can see, the inferred type has an optional property.

```
Item 21: Create Objects All at Once | 105
```

You can also use spread syntax to add multiple fields conditionally:

```
declare let hasDates: boolean ;
const nameTitle = {name: 'Khufu', title: 'Pharaoh'};
const pharaoh = { ...nameTitle, ...(hasDates && {start: -2589, end: -2566})};
// ^? const pharaoh: {
// start?: number;
// end?: number;
// name: string;
// title: string;
// }
```
In this case, both start and end have become optional fields. If you read start off

this type, you’ll have to consider the possibility that it’s undefined:

```
const {start} = pharaoh;
// ^? const start: number | undefined
```
Sometimes you want to build an object or array by transforming another one. In this

case, the equivalent of “building objects all at once” is using built-in functional con‐

structs or utility libraries like Lodash rather than loops. See Item 26 for more on this.

**Things to Remember**

- Prefer to build objects all at once rather than piecemeal.
- Use multiple objects and object spread syntax ({...a, ...b}) to add properties
    in a type-safe way.
- Know how to conditionally add properties to an object.

### Item 22: Understand Type Narrowing

Narrowing, or “refinement,” is the process by which TypeScript goes from a broad

type to a more specific one. Perhaps the most common example of this is null

checking:

```
const elem = document.getElementById('what-time-is-it');
// ^? const elem: HTMLElement | null
if (elem) {
elem.innerHTML = 'Party Time'.blink();
// ^? const elem: HTMLElement
} else {
elem
// ^? const elem: null
alert('No element #what-time-is-it');
}
```
**106 | Chapter 3: Type Inference and Control Flow Analysis**


If elem is null, then the code in the first branch won’t execute. So TypeScript is able

to exclude null from the union type within this block, resulting in a narrower type

which is much easier to work with. Because the compiler is following the paths of

execution of your code, this is also known as control flow analysis. The type checker

is generally quite good at following your logic and narrowing types in conditionals

like these, though it can occasionally be thwarted by aliasing (Item 23).

Notice how the same symbol, elem, has different static types at different locations in

your code. This is a somewhat unusual ability amongst programming languages: in

C++, Java, and Rust, for example, a variable has a single type for its entire lifetime. If

you want to narrow its type, you also need to create a new variable. But in TypeScript,

a symbol has a type at a location. Learn to take advantage of this and you’ll write

more concise, idiomatic TypeScript.

There are many ways that you can narrow a type. Throwing or returning from a

branch will narrow a variable’s type for the rest of a block:

```
const elem = document.getElementById('what-time-is-it');
// ^? const elem: HTMLElement | null
if (!elem) throw new Error('Unable to find #what-time-is-it');
elem.innerHTML = 'Party Time'.blink();
// ^? const elem: HTMLElement
```
You can also use instanceof:

```
function contains(text: string , search: string | RegExp) {
if (search instanceof RegExp) {
return !!search.exec(text);
// ^? (parameter) search: RegExp
}
return text.includes(search);
// ^? (parameter) search: string
}
```
A property check also works:

```
interface Apple { isGoodForBaking: boolean ; }
interface Orange { numSlices: number ; }
function pickFruit(fruit: Apple | Orange) {
if ('isGoodForBaking' in fruit) {
fruit
// ^? (parameter) fruit: Apple
} else {
fruit
// ^? (parameter) fruit: Orange
}
fruit
// ^? (parameter) fruit: Apple | Orange
}
```
```
Item 22: Understand Type Narrowing | 107
```

```
1 Why this quirk? The original JavaScript implementation represented objects with a type tag and a value. The
tag for objects was 0, and null was represented as a null pointer (0x0), hence its type tag was 0 , and typeof
null was "object". The standards committee attempted to fix this bug in 2011 but it broke too many
websites.
```
Some built-in functions such as Array.isArray are also able to narrow types:

```
function contains(text: string , terms: string | string []) {
const termList = Array.isArray(terms)? terms : [terms];
// ^? const termList: string[]
// ...
}
```
TypeScript is generally quite good at tracking types through conditionals. Think twice

before adding a type assertion—it might be on to something that you’re not! For

example, this is the wrong way to exclude null from a union type:

```
const elem = document.getElementById('what-time-is-it');
// ^? const elem: HTMLElement | null
if ( typeof elem === 'object') {
elem;
// ^? const elem: HTMLElement | null
}
```
Because typeof null is "object" in JavaScript, you have not, in fact, excluded null

with this check!^1 Similar surprises can come from falsy primitive values:

```
function maybeLogX(x?: number | string | null ) {
if (!x) {
console.log(x);
// ^? (parameter) x: string | number | null | undefined
}
}
```
Because the empty string and 0 are both falsy, x could still be a string or number in

that branch. TypeScript is right!

Another common way to help the type checker narrow your types is by putting an

explicit “tag” on them:

```
interface UploadEvent { type : 'upload'; filename: string ; contents: string }
interface DownloadEvent { type : 'download'; filename: string ; }
type AppEvent = UploadEvent | DownloadEvent;
```
```
function handleEvent(e: AppEvent) {
switch (e. type ) {
case 'download':
console.log('Download', e.filename);
// ^? (parameter) e: DownloadEvent
break ;
case 'upload':
```
**108 | Chapter 3: Type Inference and Control Flow Analysis**


```
console.log('Upload', e.filename, e.contents.length, 'bytes');
// ^? (parameter) e: UploadEvent
break ;
}
}
```
This is known as a “tagged union” or “discriminated union,” and it is ubiquitous in

TypeScript. Chapter 4 will revisit this pattern. When you write switch statements, it’s

a good idea to test that you’ve covered all possibilities. Item 59 shows you how.

If TypeScript isn’t able to figure out a type, you can introduce a special function to

help it out:

```
function isInputElement(el: Element): el is HTMLInputElement {
return 'value' in el;
}
```
```
function getElementContent(el: HTMLElement) {
if (isInputElement(el)) {
return el.value;
// ^? (parameter) el: HTMLInputElement
}
return el.textContent;
// ^? (parameter) el: HTMLElement
}
```
This is known as a “user-defined type guard,” and the el is HTMLInputElement

clause is called a “type predicate.” As a return type, this type tells the type checker that

it can narrow the type of the parameter if the function returns true.

Some functions are able to use type guards to narrow types in arrays or objects, nota‐

bly the filter method on Arrays:

```
const formEls = document.querySelectorAll('.my-form *');
const formInputEls = [...formEls].filter(isInputElement);
// ^? const formInputEls: HTMLInputElement[]
```
It’s important to note user-defined type guards are no safer than a type assertion (el

as HTMLInputElement): there’s nothing checking that the body of a type guard corre‐

sponds to the type predicate it returns. (In this case, in fact, there are a few Elements

with a value property that are not HTMLInputElements.)

You can often rework your code slightly to help TypeScript follow along. This code

using a Map is correct but produces a type error:

```
Item 22: Understand Type Narrowing | 109
```

```
const nameToNickname = new Map< string , string >();
declare let yourName: string ;
let nameToUse: string ;
if (nameToNickname.has(yourName)) {
nameToUse = nameToNickname.get(yourName);
// ~~~~~~ Type 'string | undefined' is not assignable to type 'string'.
} else {
nameToUse = yourName;
}
```
The issue is that TypeScript doesn’t understand the relationship between the has and

get methods of a Map. It doesn’t know that checking has eliminates the possibility of

undefined in a subsequent lookup with get. A slight change eliminates the type error

(and preserves the behavior):

```
const nickname = nameToNickname.get(yourName);
let nameToUse: string ;
if (nickname !== undefined ) {
nameToUse = nickname;
} else {
nameToUse = yourName;
}
```
This pattern is common and can be written more concisely using the “nullish coalesc‐

ing” operator (??):

```
const nameToUse = nameToNickname.get(yourName) ?? yourName;
```
If you find yourself fighting with the type checker in a conditional, think about

whether you can rework it to help TypeScript follow along.

It’s also helpful to understand when types don’t narrow. One notable example is in

callbacks:

```
function logLaterIfNumber(obj: { value: string | number }) {
if ( typeof obj.value === "number") {
setTimeout(() => console.log(obj.value.toFixed()));
// ~~~~~~~
// Property 'toFixed' does not exist on type 'string | number'.
}
}
```
We’ve done a typeof check which should narrow the type of obj.value. So why did it

revert back to the union type, which produced a type error?

It’s because the calling code might look like this:

```
const obj: { value: string | number } = { value: 123 };
logLaterIfNumber(obj);
obj.value = 'Cookie Monster';
```
**110 | Chapter 3: Type Inference and Control Flow Analysis**


By the time the callback runs, the type of obj.value has changed, invalidating the

refinement. This code throws an exception at runtime, and TypeScript is right to

warn you about it.

Understanding how types narrow will help you build an intuition for how type infer‐

ence works, make sense of errors, and generally have a more productive relationship

with the type checker.

**Things to Remember**

- Understand how TypeScript narrows types based on conditionals and other types
    of control flow.
- Use tagged/discriminated unions and user-defined type guards to help the pro‐
    cess of narrowing.
- Think about whether code can be refactored to let TypeScript follow along more
    easily.

### Item 23: Be Consistent in Your Use of Aliases

When you introduce a new name for a value:

```
const place = {name: 'New York', latLng: [41.6868, -74.2692]};
const loc = place.latLng;
```
you have created an alias. Changes to properties on the alias will be visible on the

original value as well:

```
> loc[0] = 0;
0
> place.latLng
[ 0, -74.2692 ]
```
If you’ve used a language that has pointer or reference types, this is the same idea.

There are two variables that point to the same underlying object.

Aliases are the bane of compiler writers in all languages because they make control

flow analysis difficult. If you’re deliberate in your use of aliases, TypeScript will be

able to understand your code better and help you find more real errors.

Suppose you have a data structure that represents a polygon:

```
interface Coordinate {
x: number ;
y: number ;
}
```
```
interface BoundingBox {
x: [ number , number ];
y: [ number , number ];
```
```
Item 23: Be Consistent in Your Use of Aliases | 111
```

##### }

```
interface Polygon {
exterior: Coordinate[];
holes: Coordinate[][];
bbox?: BoundingBox;
}
```
The geometry of the polygon is specified by the exterior and holes properties. (The

holes array lets you represent doughnut shapes, which have holes in the interior.)

The bbox property is an optimization that may or may not be present. You can use it

to speed up a point-in-polygon check:

```
function isPointInPolygon(polygon: Polygon, pt: Coordinate) {
if (polygon.bbox) {
if (pt.x < polygon.bbox.x[0] || pt.x > polygon.bbox.x[1] ||
pt.y < polygon.bbox.y[0] || pt.y > polygon.bbox.y[1]) {
return false ;
}
}
```
```
// ... more complex check
}
```
This code works (and type checks) but is a bit repetitive: polygon.bbox appears five

times in three lines! Here’s an attempt to factor out an intermediate variable to reduce

duplication:

```
function isPointInPolygon(polygon: Polygon, pt: Coordinate) {
const box = polygon.bbox;
if (polygon.bbox) {
if (pt.x < box.x[0] || pt.x > box.x[1] ||
// ~~~ ~~~ 'box' is possibly 'undefined'
pt.y < box.y[0] || pt.y > box.y[1]) {
// ~~~ ~~~ 'box' is possibly 'undefined'
return false ;
}
}
// ...
}
```
This code still works, so why the error? By factoring out the box variable, you’ve cre‐

ated an alias for polygon.bbox, and this has thwarted the control flow analysis that

quietly worked in the first example.

You can inspect the types of box and polygon.bbox to see what’s happening:

```
function isPointInPolygon(polygon: Polygon, pt: Coordinate) {
polygon.bbox
// ^? (property) Polygon.bbox?: BoundingBox | undefined
const box = polygon.bbox;
// ^? const box: BoundingBox | undefined
```
**112 | Chapter 3: Type Inference and Control Flow Analysis**


```
if (polygon.bbox) {
console.log(polygon.bbox);
// ^? (property) Polygon.bbox?: BoundingBox
console.log(box);
// ^? const box: BoundingBox | undefined
}
}
```
The property check refines the type of polygon.bbox but not the type of box, hence

the errors. This leads us to the golden rule of aliasing: if you introduce an alias, use it

consistently.

Using box in the property check fixes the error:

```
function isPointInPolygon(polygon: Polygon, pt: Coordinate) {
const box = polygon.bbox;
if (box) {
if (pt.x < box.x[0] || pt.x > box.x[1] ||
pt.y < box.y[0] || pt.y > box.y[1]) { // OK
return false ;
}
}
// ...
}
```
The type checker is happy now, but there’s an issue for human readers. We’re using

two names for the same thing: box and bbox. This is a distinction without a difference

(Item 41).

Object destructuring syntax rewards consistent naming by letting us write more con‐

cise code. You can even use it on arrays and nested structures:

```
function isPointInPolygon(polygon: Polygon, pt: Coordinate) {
const {bbox} = polygon;
if (bbox) {
const {x, y} = bbox;
if (pt.x < x[0] || pt.x > x[1] || pt.y < y[0] || pt.y > y[1]) {
return false ;
}
}
// ...
}
```
A few other points:

- This code would have required more property checks if the x and y properties
    had been optional, rather than the whole bbox property. We benefited from fol‐
    lowing the advice of Item 33, which discusses the importance of pushing null val‐
    ues to the perimeter of your types.

```
Item 23: Be Consistent in Your Use of Aliases | 113
```

- An optional property was appropriate for bbox but would not have been appro‐
    priate for holes. If holes was optional, then it would be possible for it to be
    either missing or an empty array ([]). This would be a distinction without a dif‐
    ference. An empty array is a fine way to indicate “no holes.”

In your interactions with the type checker, don’t forget that aliasing can introduce

confusion at runtime, too:

```
const {bbox} = polygon;
if (!bbox) {
calculatePolygonBbox(polygon); // Fills in polygon.bbox
// Now polygon.bbox and bbox refer to different values!
}
```
TypeScript’s control flow analysis tends to be quite good for local variables. But for

properties you should be on guard:

```
function expandABit(p: Polygon) { /* ... */ }
```
```
polygon.bbox
// ^? (property) Polygon.bbox?: BoundingBox | undefined
if (polygon.bbox) {
polygon.bbox
// ^? (property) Polygon.bbox?: BoundingBox
expandABit(polygon);
polygon.bbox
// ^? (property) Polygon.bbox?: BoundingBox
}
```
The call to expandABit(polygon) could very well un-set polygon.bbox, so it would

be safer for the type to revert to BoundingBox | undefined. But this would get frus‐

trating: you’d have to repeat your property checks every time you called a function. So

TypeScript makes the pragmatic choice to assume the function does not invalidate its

type refinements. Item 48 discusses other situations like this where TypeScript trades

safety for convenience.

If you’d factored out a local bbox variable instead of using polygon.bbox, the type

of bbox would remain accurate, but it might no longer be the same value as

polygon.bbox. If you’re concerned about these sorts of side effects, the best option is

to pass a read-only version of polygon to the function (Item 14). By preventing muta‐

tion, we also improve type safety. This is a concern specifically for object types

(including arrays) because they are mutable. Primitive values (numbers, strings, etc.)

are already immutable.

**114 | Chapter 3: Type Inference and Control Flow Analysis**


**Things to Remember**

- Aliasing can prevent TypeScript from narrowing types. If you create an alias for a
    variable, use it consistently.
- Be aware of how function calls can invalidate type refinements on properties.
    Trust refinements on local variables more than on properties.

### Item 24: Understand How Context Is Used in Type Inference

TypeScript doesn’t just infer types based on values. It also considers the context in

which the value occurs. This usually works well but can sometimes lead to surprises.

Understanding how context is used in type inference will help you identify and work

around these surprises when they do occur.

In JavaScript, you can factor out an expression into a constant without changing the

behavior of your code (so long as you don’t alter execution order). In other words,

these two statements are equivalent:

```
// Inline form
setLanguage('JavaScript');
```
```
// Reference form
let language = 'JavaScript';
setLanguage(language);
```
In TypeScript, this refactor still works:

```
function setLanguage(language: string ) { /* ... */ }
```
```
setLanguage('JavaScript'); // OK
```
```
let language = 'JavaScript';
setLanguage(language); // OK
```
Now suppose you take to heart the advice of Item 35 and replace the string type with

a more precise union of string literal types:

```
type Language = 'JavaScript' | 'TypeScript' | 'Python';
function setLanguage(language: Language) { /* ... */ }
```
```
setLanguage('JavaScript'); // OK
```
```
let language = 'JavaScript';
setLanguage(language);
// ~~~~~~~~ Argument of type 'string' is not assignable
// to parameter of type 'Language'
```
```
Item 24: Understand How Context Is Used in Type Inference | 115
```

What went wrong? With the inline form, TypeScript knows from the function decla‐

ration that the parameter is supposed to be of type Language. The string literal

'JavaScript' is assignable to this type, so this is OK. But when you factor out a vari‐

able, TypeScript must infer its type at the time of assignment. It applies the usual

algorithm (Item 20) and infers string, which is not assignable to Language. Hence

the error.

```
Some languages are able to infer types for variables based on their
eventual usage. But this can also be confusing. Anders Hejlsberg,
the creator of TypeScript, refers to it as “spooky action at a dis‐
tance.” By and large, TypeScript determines the type of a variable
when it is first introduced. For a notable exception to this rule, see
Item 25.
```
There are two good ways to solve this problem. One is to constrain the possible val‐

ues of language with a type annotation:

```
let language: Language = 'JavaScript';
setLanguage(language); // OK
```
This also has the benefit of flagging an error if there’s a typo in the language—for

example 'Typescript' (it should be a capital “S”).

The other solution is to make the variable constant:

```
const language = 'JavaScript';
// ^? const language: "JavaScript"
setLanguage(language); // OK
```
By using const, we’ve told the type checker that this variable cannot change. So Type‐

Script can infer a more precise type for language, namely the string literal type

"JavaScript". This is assignable to Language so the code type checks. Of course, if

you do need to reassign language, then you’ll need to use the type annotation.

The fundamental issue here is that we’ve separated the value from the context in

which it’s used. Sometimes this is OK, but often it is not. The rest of this item walks

through a few cases where this loss of context can cause errors and shows you how to

fix them.

**Tuple Types**

In addition to string literal types, problems can come up with tuple types. Suppose

you’re working with a map visualization that lets you programmatically pan the map:

```
// Parameter is a (latitude, longitude) pair.
function panTo(where: [ number , number ]) { /* ... */ }
```
```
panTo([10, 20]); // OK
```
**116 | Chapter 3: Type Inference and Control Flow Analysis**


```
const loc = [10, 20];
// ^? const loc: number[]
panTo(loc);
// ~~~ Argument of type 'number[]' is not assignable to
// parameter of type '[number, number]'
```
As before, you’ve separated a value from its context. In the first instance, [10, 20] is

assignable to the tuple type [number, number]. In the second, TypeScript infers the

type of loc as number[] (i.e., an array of numbers of unknown length). This is not

assignable to the tuple type, since many arrays have the wrong number of elements.

So how can you fix this error without resorting to any? You’ve already declared it

const, so that won’t help. But you can still provide a type annotation to let TypeScript

know precisely what you mean:

```
const loc: [ number , number ] = [10, 20];
panTo(loc); // OK
```
As Item 20 explained, another way is to provide a “const context.” This tells Type‐

Script that you intend the value to be deeply constant, rather than the shallow con‐

stant that const gives:

```
const loc = [10, 20] as const ;
// ^? const loc: readonly [10, 20]
panTo(loc);
// ~~~ The type 'readonly [10, 20]' is 'readonly'
// and cannot be assigned to the mutable type '[number, number]'
```
The type of loc is now inferred as readonly [10, 20], rather than number[].

Unfortunately this is too precise! The type signature of panTo makes no promises that

it won’t modify the contents of its where parameter. Since the loc parameter has a

readonly type, this won’t do.

The best solution here is to add a readonly annotation to the panTo function:

```
function panTo(where: readonly [ number , number ]) { /* ... */ }
const loc = [10, 20] as const ;
panTo(loc); // OK
```
If the type signature is outside your control, then you’ll need to use an annotation.

(Item 14 has more to say about readonly and type safety.)

const contexts can neatly solve issues around losing context in inference, but they do

have an unfortunate downside: if you make a mistake in the definition (say you add a

third element to the tuple), then the error will be flagged at the call site, not at the

definition. This may be confusing, especially if the error occurs in a deeply nested

object that’s used far from where it’s defined:

```
const loc = [10, 20, 30] as const ; // error is really here.
panTo(loc);
```
```
Item 24: Understand How Context Is Used in Type Inference | 117
```

```
// ~~~ Argument of type 'readonly [10, 20, 30]' is not assignable to
// parameter of type 'readonly [number, number]'
// Source has 3 element(s) but target allows only 2.
```
For this reason, it’s preferable to use the inline form or apply a type declaration.

**Objects**

The problem of separating a value from its context also comes up when you factor

out a constant from a larger object that contains some string literals or tuples. For

example:

```
type Language = 'JavaScript' | 'TypeScript' | 'Python';
interface GovernedLanguage {
language: Language;
organization: string ;
}
```
```
function complain(language: GovernedLanguage) { /* ... */ }
```
```
complain({ language: 'TypeScript', organization: 'Microsoft' }); // OK
```
```
const ts = {
language: 'TypeScript',
organization: 'Microsoft',
};
complain(ts);
// ~~ Argument of type '{ language: string; organization: string; }'
// is not assignable to parameter of type 'GovernedLanguage'
// Types of property 'language' are incompatible
// Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'Language'
```
In the ts object, the type of language is inferred as string. As before, the solution is

to add a type annotation (const ts: GovernedLanguage = ...), use a const asser‐

tion (as const), or the satisfies operator (Item 20).

**Callbacks**

When you pass a callback to another function, TypeScript uses context to infer the

parameter types of the callback:

```
function callWithRandomNumbers(fn: (n1: number , n2: number ) => void ) {
fn(Math.random(), Math.random());
}
```
```
callWithRandomNumbers((a, b) => {
// ^? (parameter) a: number
console.log(a + b);
// ^? (parameter) b: number
});
```
**118 | Chapter 3: Type Inference and Control Flow Analysis**


The types of a and b are inferred as number because of the type declaration for

callWithRandomNumbers. If you factor the callback out into a constant, you lose that

context and get noImplicitAny errors:

```
const fn = (a, b) => {
// ~ Parameter 'a' implicitly has an 'any' type
// ~ Parameter 'b' implicitly has an 'any' type
console.log(a + b);
}
callWithRandomNumbers(fn);
```
The solution is either to add type annotations to the parameters:

```
const fn = (a: number , b: number ) => {
console.log(a + b);
}
callWithRandomNumbers(fn);
```
or to apply a type declaration to the entire function expression if one is available (see

Item 12). If the function is only used in one place, prefer the inline form since it

reduces the need for annotations.

**Things to Remember**

- Be aware of how context is used in type inference.
- If factoring out a variable introduces a type error, maybe add a type annotation.
- If the variable is truly a constant, use a const assertion (as const). But be aware
    that this may result in errors surfacing at use, rather than definition.
- Prefer inlining values where it’s practical to reduce the need for type annotations.

### Item 25: Understand Evolving Types

In TypeScript, a variable’s type is generally determined when it is declared. After this,

it can be narrowed (by checking if it is null, for instance; see Item 22), but it cannot

expand to include new values. There is one notable exception to this, however, and

that is “evolving types.” Understanding how these work will reduce the need for type

annotations in your code and help you read TypeScript code that uses this convenient

pattern.

In JavaScript, you might write a function to generate a range of numbers, like this:

```
function range(start, limit) {
const nums = [];
for ( let i = start; i < limit; i++) {
nums.push(i);
}
return nums;
}
```
```
Item 25: Understand Evolving Types | 119
```

When you convert this to TypeScript, it works exactly as you’d expect:

```
function range(start: number , limit: number ) {
const nums = [];
for ( let i = start; i < limit; i++) {
nums.push(i);
}
return nums;
// ^? const nums: number[]
}
```
Upon closer inspection, however, it’s surprising that this works! How does TypeScript

know that the type of nums is number[] when it’s initialized as [], which could be an

array of any type? Clearly TypeScript is not following its usual rules for deriving a

type from a literal value (Item 20). Inspecting each of the three occurrences of nums to

reveal its inferred type starts to tell the story:

```
function range(start: number , limit: number ) {
const nums = [];
// ^? const nums: any[]
for ( let i = start; i < limit; i++) {
nums.push(i);
// ^? const nums: any[]
}
return nums;
// ^? const nums: number[]
}
```
The type of nums starts as any[], an undifferentiated array. But after we push number

values onto it, its type “evolves” to become number[].

This is distinct from narrowing (aka “refinement”). An empty array’s type can expand

by pushing different elements onto it:

```
const result = [];
// ^? const result: any[]
result.push('a');
result
// ^? const result: string[]
result.push(1);
result
// ^? const result: (string | number)[]
```
With conditionals, the type can even vary across branches. Here you can see the same

behavior with a simple value, rather than an array:

```
let value;
// ^? let value: any
if (Math.random() < 0.5) {
value = /hello/;
value
// ^? let value: RegExp
} else {
```
**120 | Chapter 3: Type Inference and Control Flow Analysis**


```
value = 12;
value
// ^? let value: number
}
value
// ^? let value: number | RegExp
```
```
This behavior can be confusing to follow in your editor since the
type is only “evolved” after you assign or push an element. Inspect‐
ing the type on the line with the assignment still shows any or
any[].
```
This construct is a convenient way to reduce the need for type annotations. You can

use it in your own code, and you should recognize it in code that you read. It’s some‐

times known as “evolving any” because the variable implicitly has an any type, but

this is not a dangerous any (more on that momentarily). It’s also sometimes called

“evolving let” or “evolving arrays.”

Another case that triggers this “evolving” behavior is if a variable is initially set to

null or undefined. This often comes up when you set a value in a try/catch block:

```
let value = null ;
// ^? let value: any
try {
value = doSomethingRiskyAndReturnANumber();
value
// ^? let value: number
} catch (e) {
console.warn('alas!');
}
value
// ^? let value: number | null
```
If you try to use an evolving type before you set it or push values onto it, you’ll get an

implicit any error:

```
function range(start: number , limit: number ) {
const nums = [];
// ~~~~ Variable 'nums' implicitly has type 'any[]' in some
// locations where its type cannot be determined
if (start === limit) {
return nums;
// ~~~~ Variable 'nums' implicitly has an 'any[]' type
}
for ( let i = start; i < limit; i++) {
nums.push(i);
}
return nums;
}
```
```
Item 25: Understand Evolving Types | 121
```

Put another way, evolving types are only any when you write to them. If you try to

read from them while they’re still any, you’ll get an error. This isn’t the scary any that

Item 5 warned you about. It won’t spread through your application like other any

types.

Implicit any types do not evolve through function calls. The arrow function here trips

up inference:

```
function makeSquares(start: number , limit: number ) {
const nums = [];
// ~~~~ Variable 'nums' implicitly has type 'any[]' in some locations
range(start, limit).forEach(i => {
nums.push(i * i);
});
return nums;
// ~~~~ Variable 'nums' implicitly has an 'any[]' type
}
```
Improved type inference is a good reason to prefer for-of loops to forEach loops in

TypeScript. For this specific case, though, it would be better to use the built-in array

map method to transform the array in a single statement, avoiding iteration and evolv‐

ing types entirely. See Item 26 for more on how functional constructs can help types

flow.

Evolving types come with all the usual caveats about type inference. Is the correct

type for your array really (string|number)[]? Or should it be number[] and you

incorrectly pushed a string? You may still want to provide an explicit type annota‐

tion to get better error checking instead of using an evolving type, or at least annotate

the return type of your function to make sure that implementation errors don’t escape

into the type signature (Item 18).

When you build an array by pushing elements onto it or set a value conditionally,

consider whether you can use the evolving type construct to reduce the need for type

annotations and to help types flow through your code.

**Things to Remember**

- While TypeScript types typically only refine, the types of values initialized to
    null, undefined, or [] are allowed to evolve.
- Recognize and understand this construct where it occurs, and use it to reduce the
    need for type annotations in your own code.
- For better error checking, consider providing an explicit type annotation instead
    of using evolving types.

### Item 26: Use Functional Constructs and Libraries to Help Types Flow

JavaScript has never included the sort of standard library you find in Python, C, or

Java. Over the years, many libraries have tried to fill the gap. jQuery provided helpers

not just for interacting with the DOM but also for iterating and mapping over objects

and arrays. Underscore focused more on providing general utility functions, and

Lodash built on this effort. Today libraries like Ramda continue to bring ideas from

functional programming into the JavaScript world.

Some features from these libraries, such as map, flatMap, filter, and reduce, have

made it into the JavaScript language itself. While these constructs (and the other ones

provided by Lodash) are helpful in JavaScript and often preferable to a hand-rolled

loop, this advantage tends to get even more lopsided when you add TypeScript to the

mix. This is because their type declarations ensure that types flow through these con‐

structs. With hand-rolled loops, you’re responsible for the types yourself.

For example, consider parsing some CSV data. You could do it in plain JavaScript in a

somewhat imperative style:

```
const csvData = "...";
const rawRows = csvData.split('\n');
const headers = rawRows[0].split(',');
```
```
const rows = rawRows.slice(1).map((rowStr) => {
const row = {};
rowStr.split(",").forEach((val, j) => {
row[headers[j]] = val;
});
return row;
});
```
More functionally minded JavaScripters might prefer to build the row objects with

reduce:

```
const rows = rawRows.slice(1)
.map((rowStr) =>
rowStr
.split(",")
.reduce((row, val, i) => ((row[headers[i]] = val), row), {})
);
```
This version saves a few characters but may be more cryptic depending on your sen‐

sibilities. Lodash’s zipObject function, which forms an object by “zipping” up arrays

of keys and values, can tighten it even further:

```
import _ from 'lodash';
const rows = rawRows.slice(1)
.map(rowStr => _.zipObject(headers, rowStr.split(',')));
```
```
Item 26: Use Functional Constructs and Libraries to Help Types Flow | 123
```

Personally, I find this the clearest of all. But is it worth the cost of adding a depend‐

ency on a third-party library to your project and requiring all your coworkers to learn

how to use it?

When you add TypeScript to the mix, it starts to tip the balance more strongly in

favor of the Lodash solution.

Both vanilla JavaScript versions of the CSV parser produce the same error in

TypeScript:

```
const rowsImperative = rawRows.slice(1).map(rowStr => {
const row = {};
rowStr.split(',').forEach((val, j) => {
row[headers[j]] = val;
// ~~~~~~~~~~~~ No index signature with a parameter of
// type 'string' was found on type '{}'
});
return row;
});
const rowsFunctional = rawRows.slice(1)
.map((rowStr) =>
rowStr
.split(",")
.reduce(
(row, val, i) => ((row[headers[i]] = val), row),
// ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ No index signature with a parameter of
// type 'string' was found on type '{}'
{}
)
);
```
The solution in each case is to provide a type annotation for {}, either {[column:

string]: string} or Record<string, string>.

The Lodash version, on the other hand, passes the type checker without modification:

```
const rowsLodash =
rawRows.slice(1).map(rowStr => _.zipObject(headers, rowStr.split(',')));
rowsLodash
// ^? const rowsLodash: _.Dictionary<string>[]
```
Dictionary is a Lodash type alias. Dictionary<string> is the same as {[key:

string]: string} or Record<string, string>. The important thing here is that the

type of rows is exactly correct, no type annotations needed.

These advantages get more pronounced as your data munging gets more elaborate.

For example, suppose you have an object containing a list of the players on each team

in the NBA:

```
interface BasketballPlayer {
name: string ;
team: string ;
```
**124 | Chapter 3: Type Inference and Control Flow Analysis**


```
2 The flat method also takes a depth parameter which complicates the type declarations.
```
```
salary: number ;
}
declare const rosters: {[team: string ]: BasketballPlayer[]};
```
To build a flat list using a loop, you might use concat with an array. This code runs

fine but does not type check:

```
let allPlayers = [];
// ~~~~~~~~~~ Variable 'allPlayers' implicitly has type 'any[]'
// in some locations where its type cannot be determined
for ( const players of Object.values(rosters)) {
allPlayers = allPlayers.concat(players);
// ~~~~~~~~~~ Variable 'allPlayers' implicitly has an 'any[]' type
}
```
(The concat method does not trigger the “evolving” behavior described in Item 25.)

To fix the error you need to add a type annotation to allPlayers:

```
let allPlayers: BasketballPlayer[] = [];
for ( const players of Object.values(rosters)) {
allPlayers = allPlayers.concat(players); // OK
}
```
But a better solution is to use Array.prototype.flat:

```
const allPlayers = Object.values(rosters).flat(); // OK
// ^? const allPlayers: BasketballPlayer[]
```
The flat method flattens a multidimensional array. Its type signature is something

like T[][] => T[].^2 This version is the most concise and requires no type annota‐

tions. As an added bonus you can use const instead of let to prevent future muta‐

tions to the allPlayers variable.

Say you want to start with allPlayers and make a list of the highest-paid players on

each team, ordered by salary.

Here’s a solution without Lodash. It requires a type annotation wherever you don’t

use functional constructs:

```
const teamToPlayers: {[team: string ]: BasketballPlayer[]} = {};
for ( const player of allPlayers) {
const {team} = player;
teamToPlayers[team] = teamToPlayers[team] || [];
teamToPlayers[team].push(player);
}
```
```
for ( const players of Object.values(teamToPlayers)) {
players.sort((a, b) => b.salary - a.salary);
}
```
```
Item 26: Use Functional Constructs and Libraries to Help Types Flow | 125
```

```
const bestPaid = Object.values(teamToPlayers).map(players => players[0]);
bestPaid.sort((playerA, playerB) => playerB.salary - playerA.salary);
console.log(bestPaid);
```
Here’s the output:

```
[
{ team: 'GSW', salary: 51915615, name: 'Stephen Curry' },
{ team: 'PHO', salary: 47649433, name: 'Kevin Durant' },
{ team: 'DEN', salary: 47607350, name: 'Nikola Jokić' },
{ team: 'PHI', salary: 47607350, name: 'Joel Embiid' },
{ team: 'LAL', salary: 47607350, name: 'LeBron James' },
...
]
```
Here’s the equivalent with Lodash:

```
const bestPaid = _(allPlayers)
.groupBy(player => player.team)
.mapValues(players => _.maxBy(players, p => p.salary)!)
.values()
.sortBy(p => -p.salary)
.value();
console.log(bestPaid.slice(0, 10));
// ^? const bestPaid: BasketballPlayer[]
```
In addition to being half the length, this code only requires a single non-null asser‐

tion (the type checker doesn’t know that the players array passed to _.maxBy is non-

empty). It makes use of a “chain,” a concept in Lodash and Underscore that lets you

write a sequence of operations in a more natural order. Instead of writing:

```
_.c(_.b(_.a(v)))
```
you write:

```
_(v).a().b().c().value()
```
The _(v) “wraps” the value, and the .value() “unwraps” it.

You can inspect each function call in the chain to see the type of the wrapped value.

It’s always correct.

It’s not a coincidence that types flow so well through built-in functional constructs

and those in libraries like Lodash. By avoiding mutation and returning new values

from every call, they are able to produce new types as well (Item 19). To a large

extent, the development of TypeScript has been driven by an attempt to accurately

model the behavior of JavaScript libraries in the wild. Take advantage of all this work

and use them!

**126 | Chapter 3: Type Inference and Control Flow Analysis**


**Things to Remember**

- Use built-in functional constructs and those in utility libraries like Lodash
    instead of hand-rolled constructs to improve type flow, increase legibility, and
    reduce the need for explicit type annotations.

### Item 27: Use async Functions Instead of Callbacks to Improve Type Flow

Classic JavaScript modeled asynchronous behavior using callbacks. This led to the

infamous “pyramid of doom”:

```
declare function fetchURL(
url: string , callback: (response: string ) => void
): void ;
```
```
fetchURL(url1, function (response1) {
fetchURL(url2, function (response2) {
fetchURL(url3, function (response3) {
// ...
console.log(1);
});
console.log(2);
});
console.log(3);
});
console.log(4);
```
```
// Logs:
// 4
// 3
// 2
// 1
```
This code is heavily nested and, as you can see from the logs, the execution order is

the opposite of the code order. This makes callback code hard to read. It gets even

more confusing if you want to run the requests concurrently or bail when an error

occurs.

ES2015 introduced the concept of a Promise to break the pyramid of doom. A

Promise represents something that will be available in the future (they’re also some‐

times called “futures”). Here’s the same code using Promises:

```
const page1Promise = fetch(url1);
page1Promise.then(response1 => {
return fetch(url2);
}).then(response2 => {
return fetch(url3);
}).then(response3 => {
```
```
Item 27: Use async Functions Instead of Callbacks to Improve Type Flow | 127
```

##### // ...

```
}). catch (error => {
// ...
});
```
Now there’s less nesting, and the execution order more directly matches the code

order. It’s also easier to consolidate error handling and use higher-order tools like

Promise.all.

ES2017 introduced the async and await keywords to make things even more concise:

```
async function fetchPages() {
const response1 = await fetch(url1);
const response2 = await fetch(url2);
const response3 = await fetch(url3);
// ...
}
```
The await keyword pauses execution of the fetchPages function until each Promise

resolves. Within an async function, awaiting a Promise that rejects will throw an

exception. This lets you use the usual try/catch machinery:

```
async function fetchPages() {
try {
const response1 = await fetch(url1);
const response2 = await fetch(url2);
const response3 = await fetch(url3);
// ...
} catch (e) {
// ...
}
}
```
Just like exceptions, Promise rejections in TypeScript are untyped.

async and await are supported by all recent JavaScript runtimes, but even if you tar‐

get ES5 or earlier, the TypeScript compiler will perform some elaborate transforma‐

tions to make async and await work. In other words, whatever your runtime, with

TypeScript you can use async/await.

There are a few good reasons to prefer Promises or async/await to callbacks:

- Promises are easier to compose than callbacks.
- Types are able to flow through Promises more easily than callbacks.

If you want to fetch the pages concurrently, for example, you can compose Promises

with Promise.all:

**128 | Chapter 3: Type Inference and Control Flow Analysis**


```
async function fetchPages() {
const [response1, response2, response3] = await Promise.all([
fetch(url1), fetch(url2), fetch(url3)
]);
// ...
}
```
Using destructuring assignment with await is particularly nice in this context.

TypeScript is able to infer the types of each of the three response variables as

Response. The equivalent code to issue the requests concurrently with callbacks

requires more machinery and a type annotation:

```
function fetchPagesWithCallbacks() {
let numDone = 0;
const responses: string [] = [];
const done = () => {
const [response1, response2, response3] = responses;
// ...
};
const urls = [url1, url2, url3];
urls.forEach((url, i) => {
fetchURL(url, r => {
responses[i] = url;
numDone++;
if (numDone === urls.length) done();
});
});
}
```
Extending this to include error handling or to be as generic as Promise.all is

challenging.

Type inference also works well with Promise.race, which resolves when the first of

its input Promises resolves. You can use this to add timeouts to Promises in a general

way:

```
function timeout(timeoutMs: number ): Promise< never > {
return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
setTimeout(() => reject('timeout'), timeoutMs);
});
}
```
```
async function fetchWithTimeout(url: string , timeoutMs: number ) {
return Promise.race([fetch(url), timeout(timeoutMs)]);
}
```
The return type of fetchWithTimeout is inferred as Promise<Response>, no type

annotations required. It’s interesting to dig into why this works: the return type of

Promise.race is the union of the types of its inputs, in this case Promise<Response |

never>. But taking a union with never (the empty set) is a no-op, so this gets

```
Item 27: Use async Functions Instead of Callbacks to Improve Type Flow | 129
```

simplified to Promise<Response>. When you work with Promises, all of TypeScript’s

type inference machinery works to get you the right types.

You may occasionally need to use raw Promises, notably when you are wrapping a

callback API like setTimeout. But if you have a choice, you should generally prefer

async/await to raw Promises for two reasons:

- It typically produces more concise and straightforward code.
- It enforces that async functions always return Promises.

This latter property helps avoid a confusing class of bugs. By definition, an async

function always returns a Promise. This is true even if it doesn’t await anything.

TypeScript can help you build an intuition for this:

```
async function getNumber() { return 42; }
// ^? function getNumber(): Promise<number>
```
You can also create async arrow functions:

```
const getNumber = async () => 42;
// ^? const getNumber: () => Promise<number>
```
The raw Promise equivalent is:

```
const getNumber = () => Promise.resolve(42);
// ^? const getNumber: () => Promise<number>
```
While it may seem odd to return a Promise for an immediately available value, this

actually helps enforce an important rule: a function should either always be run syn‐

chronously or always be run asynchronously. It should never mix the two.

To see how breaking this rule can lead to chaos, let’s try to add a cache to the fetch

URL function:

```
// Don't do this!
const _cache: {[url: string ]: string } = {};
function fetchWithCache(url: string , callback: (text: string ) => void ) {
if (url in _cache) {
callback(_cache[url]);
} else {
fetchURL(url, text => {
_cache[url] = text;
callback(text);
});
}
}
```
While invoking the callback immediately may seem like an optimization, the function

is now extremely difficult for a client to use:

```
let requestStatus: 'loading' | 'success' | 'error';
function getUser(userId: string ) {
```
**130 | Chapter 3: Type Inference and Control Flow Analysis**


```
3 There’s still a more subtle bug in this version: if you call fetchWithCache twice in a row with the same URL, it
will issue two requests. How would you fix this?
```
```
fetchWithCache(`/user/${userId}`, profile => {
requestStatus = 'success';
});
requestStatus = 'loading';
}
```
What will the value of requestStatus be after calling getUser? It depends entirely on

whether the profile is cached. If it’s not, requestStatus will be set to “success.” If it is,

it’ll get set to “success” and then set back to “loading.” Oops!

Using async for both functions enforces consistent behavior:

```
const _cache: {[url: string ]: string } = {};
async function fetchWithCache(url: string ) {
if (url in _cache) {
return _cache[url];
}
const response = await fetch(url);
const text = await response.text();
_cache[url] = text;
return text;
}
```
```
let requestStatus: 'loading' | 'success' | 'error';
async function getUser(userId: string ) {
requestStatus = 'loading';
const profile = await fetchWithCache(`/user/${userId}`);
requestStatus = 'success';
}
```
Now it’s completely transparent that requestStatus will end in “success.” It’s easy to

accidentally produce half-synchronous code with callbacks or raw Promises, but diffi‐

cult with async.^3

Note that if you return a Promise from an async function, it will not get wrapped in

another Promise: the return type will be Promise<T> rather than Promise

<Promise<T>>. Again, TypeScript will help you build an intuition for this:

```
async function getJSON(url: string ) {
const response = await fetch(url);
const jsonPromise = response.json();
return jsonPromise;
// ^? const jsonPromise: Promise<any>
}
getJSON
// ^? function getJSON(url: string): Promise<any>
```
```
Item 27: Use async Functions Instead of Callbacks to Improve Type Flow | 131
```

**Things to Remember**

- Prefer Promises to callbacks for better composability and type flow.
- Prefer async and await to raw Promises when possible. They produce more con‐
    cise, straightforward code and eliminate whole classes of errors.
- If a function returns a Promise, declare it async.

### Item 28: Use Classes and Currying to Create New Inference Sites

Suppose you define an API using a TypeScript interface:

```
export interface SeedAPI {
'/seeds': Seed[];
'/seed/apple': Seed;
'/seed/strawberry': Seed;
// ...
}
```
This says that our API has a /seeds endpoint that returns an array of Seed objects.

The /seed/apple and /seed/strawberry endpoints return one Seed object.

Let’s write a function that issues requests to our API endpoints. This function should

check that the endpoints exist, and it should return the correct type of data. This will

be extremely helpful for making safe API calls from the client.

Here’s how that function should work:

```
// Correct usage:
const berry = await fetchAPI<SeedAPI>('/seed/strawberry'); // OK, returns Seed
```
```
// Incorrect usage; these should be errors:
fetchAPI<SeedAPI>('/seed/chicken'); // endpoint doesn't exist
const seed: Seed = await fetchAPI<SeedAPI>('/seeds'); // wrong return type
```
Here’s how you might declare fetchAPI (we’re not concerned about the implementa‐

tion here, just the types):

```
declare function fetchAPI<
API, Path extends keyof API
>(path: Path): Promise<API[Path]>;
```
Unfortunately, when you try to use this, you’ll get an error:

```
fetchAPI<SeedAPI>('/seed/strawberry');
// ~~~~~~~ Expected 2 type arguments, but got 1.
```
The problem is that type inference in TypeScript is an all or nothing affair: either you

can let TypeScript infer all the type parameters from usage, or you can specify all of

**132 | Chapter 3: Type Inference and Control Flow Analysis**


them explicitly. There’s no in-between. (You can provide a default value for a type

parameter, but this can only reference other type parameters; it can’t be inferred from

usage.)

The API type parameter could be anything: since we’d like fetchAPI to work with any

API, it can’t possibly be inferred. It has to be specified explicitly. So it would seem the

only solution here is to write the Path type explicitly, too:

```
const berry = fetchAPI<SeedAPI, '/seed/strawberry'>('/seed/strawberry'); // ok
// ^? const berry: Promise<Seed>
```
This works, but it’s frustratingly repetitive. Surely there’s a better way. We need to

somehow separate the place where we explicitly write the API type parameter from

the place where we infer the Path type parameter.

There are two standard ways to do this: classes and currying.

**Classes**

Classes are very good at capturing bits of state. They spare you from having to repeat‐

edly pass the same state to a set of related functions (the class’s methods). In Type‐

Script, it turns out that classes are also very good at capturing types.

Here’s how you can define a class to solve this problem:

```
declare class ApiFetcher<API> {
fetch<Path extends keyof API>(path: Path): Promise<API[Path]>;
}
```
And here’s how you use it:

```
const fetcher = new ApiFetcher<SeedAPI>();
const berry = await fetcher.fetch('/seed/strawberry'); // OK
// ^? const berry: Seed
```
```
fetcher.fetch('/seed/chicken');
// ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
// Argument of type '"/seed/chicken"' is not assignable to type 'keyof SeedAPI'
```
```
const seed: Seed = await fetcher.fetch('/seeds');
// ~~~~ Seed[] is not assignable to Seed
```
This produces exactly the errors we were hoping for. (You also need to implement the

class, of course! We’re just focusing on the types here.)

What used to be a function that needed two generic type parameters is now a class

with one generic type parameter that you specify explicitly, and a method with one

generic type parameter that’s inferred. TypeScript is perfectly happy to let you bind

the API type parameter when you call the class’s constructor (new ApiFetcher

<SeedAPI>()) and then infer Path when you call the fetch method.

```
Item 28: Use Classes and Currying to Create New Inference Sites | 133
```

Using classes to create a distinct binding site is particularly effective when you have

multiple methods that all require the same type parameter.

**Currying**

Fun fact: programming languages don’t really need functions with more than one

parameter. Instead of:

```
declare function getDate(mon: string , day: number ): Date;
getDate('dec', 25);
```
you could write a function that returns another function:

```
declare function getDate(mon: string ): (day: number ) => Date;
getDate('dec')(25);
```
Note the slightly different syntax to call the second version. This practice is known as

currying, after the logician Haskell Curry, who always disavowed having come up

with the technique.

Currying gives us the flexibility we need to introduce as many inference sites as we

like. Each function call can infer new type parameters.

Here’s how you can rework fetchAPI using functions that return functions:

```
declare function fetchAPI<API>():
<Path extends keyof API>(path: Path) => Promise<API[Path]>;
```
Now fetchAPI takes no parameters, but it returns a function that takes one. Here’s

how you use it:

```
const berry = await fetchAPI<SeedAPI>()('/seed/strawberry'); // OK
// ^? const berry: Seed
```
```
fetchAPI<SeedAPI>()('/seed/chicken');
// ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
// Argument of type '"/seed/chicken"' is not assignable to type 'keyof SeedAPI'
//
const seed: Seed = await fetchAPI<SeedAPI>()('/seeds');
// ~~~~ Seed[] is not assignable to Seed
```
Just like the class solution, this works in the case where we want it to and produces

the desired error in the others. You can use an intermediate variable to separate out

the two function calls to reduce repetition:

```
const fetchSeedAPI = fetchAPI<SeedAPI>();
const berry = await fetchSeedAPI('/seed/strawberry');
// ^? const berry: Seed
```
The currying approach isn’t as distinct from the class approach as it might initially

appear. If you use a different name and return an object type instead of a function,

they look nearly identical:

**134 | Chapter 3: Type Inference and Control Flow Analysis**


```
declare function apiFetcher<API>(): {
fetch<Path extends keyof API>(path: Path): Promise<API[Path]>;
}
```
```
const fetcher = apiFetcher<SeedAPI>();
fetcher.fetch('/seed/strawberry'); // ok
```
The only difference in usage between this and the class example is the keyword new.

If you want to specify some generic parameters explicitly while allowing others to be

inferred, classes and currying are your two options.

So which one should you prefer? Ultimately it’s up to you. Whichever one feels most

comfortable and produces the API you find most convenient is the way to go. The

currying approach does have at least one advantage in the context of TypeScript,

however: it creates a scope in which you can define local type aliases:

```
function fetchAPI<API>() {
type Routes = keyof API & string ; // local type alias
```
```
return <Path extends Routes>(
path: Path
): Promise<API[Path]> => fetch(path).then(r => r.json());
}
```
You can’t do this with just a declaration: only the implementation introduces a new

scope. Local type aliases like Routes can cut down on repetition involving complex

type expressions. There is no equivalent of this for classes.

**Things to Remember**

- For functions with multiple type parameters, inference is all or nothing: either all
    type parameters are inferred or all must be specified explicitly.
- To get partial inference, use either classes or currying to create a new inference
    site.
- Prefer the currying approach if you’d like to create a local type alias.

**CHAPTER 4**

### Type Design

```
Show me your flowcharts and conceal your tables, and I shall continue to be mystified.
Show me your tables, and I won’t usually need your flowcharts; they’ll be obvious.
—Fred Brooks, The Mythical Man Month (Addison-Wesley Professional)
```
The language in Fred Brooks’s quote is dated, but the sentiment remains true: code is

difficult to understand if you can’t see the data or data types on which it operates.

This is one of the great advantages of a type system: by writing out types, you make

them visible to readers of your code. And this makes your code understandable.

Other chapters cover the nuts and bolts of TypeScript types: using them, inferring

them, transforming them, and writing declarations with them. This chapter discusses

the design of the types themselves. The examples in this chapter are all written with

TypeScript in mind, but most of the ideas are more broadly applicable.

If you write your types well, then with any luck your flowcharts will be obvious, too.

### Item 29: Prefer Types That Always Represent Valid States

If you design your types well, your code should be straightforward to write. But if you

design your types poorly, no amount of cleverness or documentation will save you.

Your code will be confusing and prone to bugs.

A key to effective type design is crafting types that can only represent a valid state.

This item walks through a few examples of how this can go wrong and shows you

how to fix them.

Suppose you’re building a web application that lets you select a page, loads the con‐

tent of that page, and then displays it. You might write the state like this:

##### 137


```
interface State {
pageText: string ;
isLoading: boolean ;
error?: string ;
}
```
When you write your code to render the page, you need to consider all of these fields:

```
function renderPage(state: State) {
if (state.error) {
return `Error! Unable to load ${currentPage}: ${state.error}`;
} else if (state.isLoading) {
return `Loading ${currentPage}...`;
}
return `<h1>${currentPage}</h1>\n${state.pageText}`;
}
```
Is this right, though? What if isLoading and error are both set? What would that

mean? Is it better to display the loading message or the error message? It’s hard to say!

There’s not enough information available.

Or what if you’re writing a changePage function? Here’s an attempt:

```
async function changePage(state: State, newPage: string ) {
state.isLoading = true ;
try {
const response = await fetch(getUrlForPage(newPage));
if (!response.ok) {
throw new Error(`Unable to load ${newPage}: ${response.statusText}`);
}
const text = await response.text();
state.isLoading = false ;
state.pageText = text;
} catch (e) {
state.error = '' + e;
}
}
```
There are many problems with this! Here are a few:

- We forgot to set state.isLoading to false in the error case.
- We didn’t clear out state.error, so if the previous request failed, then you’ll
    keep seeing that error message instead of a loading message or the new page.
- If the user changes pages again while the page is loading, who knows what will
    happen. They might see a new page and then an error, or the first page and not
    the second, depending on the order in which the responses come back.

The problem is that the state includes both too little information (which request

failed? which is loading?) and too much: the State type allows both isLoading and

**138 | Chapter 4: Type Design**


error to be set, even though this represents an invalid state. This makes both

render() and changePage() impossible to implement well.

Here’s a better way to represent the application state:

```
interface RequestPending {
state: 'pending';
}
interface RequestError {
state: 'error';
error: string ;
}
interface RequestSuccess {
state: 'ok';
pageText: string ;
}
type RequestState = RequestPending | RequestError | RequestSuccess;
```
```
interface State {
currentPage: string ;
requests: {[page: string ]: RequestState};
}
```
This uses a tagged union (also known as a “discriminated union”) to explicitly model

the different states that a network request can be in. This version of the state is three

to four times longer, but it has the enormous advantage of not admitting invalid

states. The current page is modeled explicitly, as is the state of every request that you

issue. As a result, the renderPage and changePage functions are easy to implement:

```
function renderPage(state: State) {
const {currentPage} = state;
const requestState = state.requests[currentPage];
switch (requestState.state) {
case 'pending':
return `Loading ${currentPage}...`;
case 'error':
return `Error! Unable to load ${currentPage}: ${requestState.error}`;
case 'ok':
return `<h1>${currentPage}</h1>\n${requestState.pageText}`;
}
}
```
```
async function changePage(state: State, newPage: string ) {
state.requests[newPage] = {state: 'pending'};
state.currentPage = newPage;
try {
const response = await fetch(getUrlForPage(newPage));
if (!response.ok) {
throw new Error(`Unable to load ${newPage}: ${response.statusText}`);
}
const pageText = await response.text();
state.requests[newPage] = {state: 'ok', pageText};
```
```
Item 29: Prefer Types That Always Represent Valid States | 139
```

```
} catch (e) {
state.requests[newPage] = {state: 'error', error: '' + e};
}
}
```
The ambiguity from the first implementation is entirely gone: it’s clear what the cur‐

rent page is, and every request is in exactly one state. If the user changes the page

after a request has been issued, that’s no problem either. The old request still com‐

pletes, but it doesn’t affect the UI.

For a simpler but more dire example, consider the fate of Air France Flight 447, an

Airbus 330 that disappeared over the Atlantic on June 1, 2009. The Airbus was a fly-

by-wire aircraft, meaning that the pilots’ control inputs went through a computer sys‐

tem before affecting the physical control surfaces of the plane. In the wake of the

crash, many questions were raised about the wisdom of relying on computers to

make such life-and-death decisions. Two years later when the black box recorders

were recovered from the bottom of the ocean, they revealed many factors that led to

the crash. A key factor was bad state design.

The cockpit of the Airbus 330 had a separate set of controls for the pilot and copilot.

The “side sticks” controlled the angle of attack. Pulling back would send the airplane

into a climb, while pushing forward would make it dive. The Airbus 330 used a sys‐

tem called “dual input” mode, which let the two side sticks move independently.

Here’s how you might model its state in TypeScript:

```
interface CockpitControls {
/** Angle of the left side stick in degrees, 0 = neutral, + = forward */
leftSideStick: number ;
/** Angle of the right side stick in degrees, 0 = neutral, + = forward */
rightSideStick: number ;
}
```
Suppose you were given this data structure and asked to write a getStickSetting

function that computed the current stick setting. How would you do it?

One way would be to assume that the pilot (who sits on the left) is in control:

```
function getStickSetting(controls: CockpitControls) {
return controls.leftSideStick;
}
```
But what if the copilot has taken control? Maybe you should use whichever stick is

away from zero:

```
function getStickSetting(controls: CockpitControls) {
const {leftSideStick, rightSideStick} = controls;
if (leftSideStick === 0) {
return rightSideStick;
}
return leftSideStick;
}
```
**140 | Chapter 4: Type Design**


But there’s a problem with this implementation: we can only be confident returning

the left setting if the right one is neutral. So you should check for that:

```
function getStickSetting(controls: CockpitControls) {
const {leftSideStick, rightSideStick} = controls;
if (leftSideStick === 0) {
return rightSideStick;
} else if (rightSideStick === 0) {
return leftSideStick;
}
// ???
}
```
What do you do if they’re both non-zero? Hopefully they’re about the same, in which

case you could just average them:

```
function getStickSetting(controls: CockpitControls) {
const {leftSideStick, rightSideStick} = controls;
if (leftSideStick === 0) {
return rightSideStick;
} else if (rightSideStick === 0) {
return leftSideStick;
}
if (Math.abs(leftSideStick - rightSideStick) < 5) {
return (leftSideStick + rightSideStick) / 2;
}
// ???
}
```
But what if they’re not? Can you throw an error? Not really: the wing flaps need to be

set at some angle!

On Air France 447, the copilot silently pulled back on his side stick as the plane

entered a storm. It gained altitude but eventually lost speed and entered a stall, a con‐

dition in which the plane is moving too slowly to effectively generate lift. It began to

drop.

To escape a stall, pilots are trained to push the controls forward to make the plane

dive and regain speed. This is exactly what the pilot did. But the copilot was still

silently pulling back on his side stick. And the Airbus function looked like this:

```
function getStickSetting(controls: CockpitControls) {
return (controls.leftSideStick + controls.rightSideStick) / 2;
}
```
Even though the pilot pushed the stick fully forward, it averaged out to nothing. He

had no idea why the plane wasn’t diving. By the time the copilot revealed what he’d

done, the plane had lost too much altitude to recover and it crashed into the ocean,

killing all 228 people on board.

The point of all this is that there is no good way to implement getStickSetting

given that input! The function has been set up to fail. In most planes the two sets of

```
Item 29: Prefer Types That Always Represent Valid States | 141
```

controls are mechanically connected. If the copilot pulls back, the pilot’s controls will

also pull back. The state of these controls is simple to express:

```
interface CockpitControls {
/** Angle of the stick in degrees, 0 = neutral, + = forward */
stickAngle: number ;
}
```
And now, as in the Fred Brooks quote from the start of the chapter, our flowcharts are

obvious. You don’t need a getStickSetting function at all.

As you design your types, take care to think about which values you are including

and which you are excluding. If you only allow values that represent valid states, your

code will be easier to write and TypeScript will have an easier time checking it. This is

a very general principle, and several of the other items in this chapter will cover spe‐

cific manifestations of it.

**Things to Remember**

- Types that represent both valid and invalid states are likely to lead to confusing
    and error-prone code.
- Prefer types that only represent valid states. Even if they are longer or harder to
    express, they will save you time and pain in the end!

### Item 30: Be Liberal in What You Accept and Strict in What You Produce

This idea is known as the robustness principle or Postel’s Law, after Jon Postel, who

wrote it in the context of the TCP networking protocol:

```
TCP implementations should follow a general principle of robustness: be conservative
in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others.
```
A similar rule applies to the contracts for functions. It’s fine for your functions to be

broad in what they accept as inputs, but they should generally be more specific in

what they produce as outputs.

As an example, a 3D mapping API might provide a way to position the camera and

calculate a viewport for a bounding box:

```
declare function setCamera(camera: CameraOptions): void ;
declare function viewportForBounds(bounds: LngLatBounds): CameraOptions;
```
It is convenient that the result of viewportForBounds can be passed directly to

setCamera to position the camera.

**142 | Chapter 4: Type Design**


Let’s look at the definitions of these types:

```
interface CameraOptions {
center?: LngLat;
zoom?: number ;
bearing?: number ;
pitch?: number ;
}
type LngLat =
{ lng: number ; lat: number ; } |
{ lon: number ; lat: number ; } |
[ number , number ];
```
The fields in CameraOptions are all optional because you might want to set just the

center or zoom without changing the bearing or pitch. The LngLat type also makes

setCamera liberal in what it accepts: you can pass in a {lng, lat} object, a {lon,

lat} object, or a [lng, lat] pair if you’re confident you got the order right. These

accommodations make the function easy to call.

The viewportForBounds function takes in another “liberal” type:

```
type LngLatBounds =
{northeast: LngLat, southwest: LngLat} |
[LngLat, LngLat] |
[ number , number , number , number ];
```
You can specify the bounds either using named corners, a pair of lat/lngs, or a four-

tuple if you’re confident you got the order right. Since LngLat already accommodates

three forms, there are no fewer than 19 possible forms for LngLatBounds (3 × 3 + 3 ×

3 + 1). Liberal indeed!

Now let’s write a function that adjusts the viewport to accommodate a GeoJSON fea‐

ture and stores the new viewport in the URL (we’ll assume we have a helper function

to calculate the bounding box of a GeoJSON feature):

```
function focusOnFeature(f: Feature) {
const bounds = calculateBoundingBox(f); // helper function
const camera = viewportForBounds(bounds);
setCamera(camera);
const {center: {lat, lng}, zoom} = camera;
// ~~~ Property 'lat' does not exist on type ...
// ~~~ Property 'lng' does not exist on type ...
zoom;
// ^? const zoom: number | undefined
window.location.search = `?v=@${lat},${lng}z${zoom}`;
}
```
Whoops! Only the zoom property exists, but its type is inferred as number|undefined,

which is also problematic. The issue is that the type declaration for viewportFor

Bounds indicates that it is liberal not just in what it accepts but also in what it

```
Item 30: Be Liberal in What You Accept and Strict in What You Produce | 143
```

produces. The only type-safe way to use the camera result is to introduce a code

branch for each component of the union type.

The return type with lots of optional properties and union types makes viewportFor

Bounds difficult to use. Its broad parameter type is convenient, but its broad return

type is not. A more convenient API would be strict in what it produces.

One way to do this is to distinguish a canonical format for coordinates. Following

JavaScript’s convention of distinguishing “array” and “array-like” (Item 17), you can

draw a distinction between LngLat and LngLatLike. You can also distinguish between

a fully defined Camera type and the partial version accepted by setCamera:

```
interface LngLat { lng: number ; lat: number ; };
type LngLatLike = LngLat | { lon: number ; lat: number ; } | [ number , number ];
```
```
interface Camera {
center: LngLat;
zoom: number ;
bearing: number ;
pitch: number ;
}
interface CameraOptions extends Omit<Partial<Camera>, 'center'> {
center?: LngLatLike;
}
type LngLatBounds =
{northeast: LngLatLike, southwest: LngLatLike} |
[LngLatLike, LngLatLike] |
[ number , number , number , number ];
```
```
declare function setCamera(camera: CameraOptions): void ;
declare function viewportForBounds(bounds: LngLatBounds): Camera;
```
The loose CameraOptions type adapts the stricter Camera type. Using Partial

<Camera> as the parameter type in setCamera would not work here since you do want

to allow LngLatLike objects for the center property. And you can’t write "Camera

Options extends Partial<Camera>" since LngLatLike is a supertype of LngLat, not

a subtype. (If this feels backwards, head over to Item 7 for a refresher.)

If this seems too complicated, you could also write the type out explicitly at the cost

of some repetition:

```
interface CameraOptions {
center?: LngLatLike;
zoom?: number ;
bearing?: number ;
pitch?: number ;
}
```
**144 | Chapter 4: Type Design**


In either case, with these new type declarations the focusOnFeature function passes

the type checker:

```
function focusOnFeature(f: Feature) {
const bounds = calculateBoundingBox(f);
const camera = viewportForBounds(bounds);
setCamera(camera);
const {center: {lat, lng}, zoom} = camera; // OK
// ^? const zoom: number
window.location.search = `?v=@${lat},${lng}z${zoom}`;
}
```
This time the type of zoom is number, rather than number|undefined. The viewport

ForBounds function is now much easier to use. If there were any other functions that

produced bounds, you would also need to introduce a canonical form and a distinc‐

tion between LngLatBounds and LngLatBoundsLike.

Is allowing 19 possible forms of bounding box a good design? Perhaps not. But if

you’re writing type declarations for a library that does this, you need to model its

behavior. Just don’t have 19 return types!

One of the most common applications of this pattern is to functions that take arrays

as parameters. For example, here’s a function that sums the elements of an array:

```
function sum(xs: number []): number {
let sum = 0;
for ( const x of xs) {
sum += x;
}
return sum;
}
```
The return type of number is quite strict. Great! But what about the parameter type of

number[]? We’re not using many of its capabilities, so it could be looser. Item 17 dis‐

cussed the ArrayLike type, and ArrayLike<number> would work well here. Item 14

discussed readonly arrays, and readonly number[] would also work well as a

parameter type.

But if you only need to iterate over the parameter, then Iterable is the broadest type

of all:

```
function sum(xs: Iterable< number >): number {
let sum = 0;
for ( const x of xs) {
sum += x;
}
return sum;
}
```
```
Item 30: Be Liberal in What You Accept and Strict in What You Produce | 145
```

This works as you’d expect with an array:

```
const six = sum([1, 2, 3]);
// ^? const six: number
```
The advantage of using Iterable here instead of Array or ArrayLike is that it also

allows generator expressions:

```
function * range(limit: number ) {
for ( let i = 0; i < limit; i++) {
yield i;
}
}
const zeroToNine = range(10);
// ^? const zeroToNine: Generator<number, void, unknown>
const fortyFive = sum(zeroToNine); // ok, result is 45
```
If your function just needs to iterate over its parameter, use Iterable to make it work

with generators as well. If you’re using for-of loops then you won’t need to change a

single line of your code.

**Things to Remember**

- Input types tend to be broader than output types. Optional properties and union
    types are more common in parameter types than return types.
- Avoid broad return types since these will be awkward for clients to use.
- To reuse types between parameters and return types, introduce a canonical form
    (for return types) and a looser form (for parameters).
- Use Iterable<T> instead of T[] if you only need to iterate over your function
    parameter.

### Item 31: Don’t Repeat Type Information in Documentation

What’s wrong with this code?

```
/**
* Returns a string with the foreground color.
* Takes zero or one arguments. With no arguments, returns the
* standard foreground color. With one argument, returns the foreground color
* for a particular page.
*/
function getForegroundColor(page?: string ) {
return page === 'login'? {r: 127, g: 127, b: 127} : {r: 0, g: 0, b: 0};
}
```
**146 | Chapter 4: Type Design**


The code and the comment disagree! Without more context it’s hard to say which is

right, but something is clearly amiss. As a professor of mine used to say, “when your

code and your comments disagree, they’re both wrong!”

Let’s assume that the code represents the desired behavior. There are a few issues with

this comment:

- It says that the function returns the color as a string when it actually returns an
    {r, g, b} object.
- It explains that the function takes zero or one arguments, which is already clear
    from the type signature.
- It’s needlessly wordy: the comment is longer than the function declaration and
    implementation!

TypeScript’s type annotation system is designed to be compact, descriptive, and read‐

able. Its developers are language experts with decades of experience. It’s almost cer‐

tainly a better way to express the types of your function’s inputs and outputs than

your prose!

And because your type annotations are checked by the TypeScript compiler, they’ll

never get out of sync with the implementation. Perhaps getForegroundColor used to

return a string but was later changed to return an object. The person who made the

change might have forgotten to update the long comment.

Nothing stays in sync unless it’s forced to. With type annotations, TypeScript’s type

checker is that force! If you put type information in annotations rather than docu‐

mentation, you greatly increase your confidence that it will remain correct as the code

evolves.

A better comment might look like this:

```
/** Get the foreground color for the application or a specific page. */
function getForegroundColor(page?: string ): Color {
// ...
}
```
If you want to describe a particular parameter, use an @param JSDoc annotation. See

Item 68 for more on this.

Comments about a lack of mutation are also suspect:

```
/** Sort the strings by numeric value (i.e. "2" < "10"). Does not modify nums. */
function sortNumerically(nums: string []): string [] {
return nums.sort((a, b) => Number(a) - Number(b));
}
```
```
Item 31: Don’t Repeat Type Information in Documentation | 147
```

The comment says that this function doesn’t modify its parameter, but the sort

method on Arrays operates in place, so it very much does. Claims in comments don’t

count for much.

If you declare the parameter readonly instead (Item 14), then you can let TypeScript

enforce the contract:

```
/** Sort the strings by numeric value (i.e. "2" < "10"). */
function sortNumerically(nums: readonly string []): string [] {
return nums.sort((a, b) => Number(a) - Number(b));
// ~~~~ ~ ~ Property 'sort' does not exist on 'readonly string[]'.
}
```
A correct implementation of this function would either copy the array or use the

immutable toSorted method:

```
/** Sort the strings by numeric value (i.e. "2" < "10"). */
function sortNumerically(nums: readonly string []): string [] {
return nums.toSorted((a, b) => Number(a) - Number(b)); // ok
}
```
What’s true for comments is also true for variable names. Avoid putting types in

them: rather than naming a variable ageNum, name it age and make sure it’s really a

number.

An exception to this is for numbers with units. If it’s not clear what the units are, you

may want to include them in a variable or property name. For instance, timeMs is a

much clearer name than just time, and temperatureC is a much clearer name than

temperature. Item 64 describes “brands,” which provide a more type-safe approach

to modeling units.

**Things to Remember**

- Avoid repeating type information in comments and variable names. In the best
    case it is duplicative of type declarations, and in the worst case it will lead to con‐
    flicting information.
- Declare parameters readonly rather than saying that you don’t mutate them.
- Consider including units in variable names if they aren’t clear from the type (e.g.,
    timeMs or temperatureC).

### Item 32: Avoid Including null or undefined in Type Aliases

In this code, is the optional chain (?.) necessary? Could user ever be null?

```
function getCommentsForUser(comments: readonly Comment[], user: User) {
return comments.filter(comment => comment.userId === user?.id);
}
```
**148 | Chapter 4: Type Design**


Even assuming strictNullChecks, it’s impossible to say without seeing the definition

of User. If it’s a type alias that allows null or undefined, then the optional chain is

needed:

```
type User = { id: string ; name: string ; } | null ;
```
On the other hand, if it’s a simple object type, then it’s not:

```
interface User {
id: string ;
name: string ;
}
```
As a general rule, it’s better to avoid type aliases that allow null or undefined values.

While the type checker won’t be confused if you break this rule, human readers of

your code will be. When we read a type name like User, we assume that it represents a

user, rather than maybe representing a user.

If you must include null in a type alias for some reason, do readers of your code a

favor and use a name that’s unambiguous:

```
type NullableUser = { id: string ; name: string ; } | null ;
```
But why do that when User|null is a more succinct and universally recognizable

syntax?

```
function getCommentsForUser(comments: readonly Comment[], user: User | null ) {
return comments.filter(comment => comment.userId === user?.id);
}
```
This rule is about the top level of type aliases. It’s not concerned with a null or

undefined (or optional) property in a larger object:

```
type BirthdayMap = {
[name: string ]: Date | undefined ;
};
```
Just don’t do this:

```
type BirthdayMap = {
[name: string ]: Date | undefined ;
} | null ;
```
There are also reasons to avoid null values and optional fields in object types, but

that’s a topic for Items 33 and 37. For now, avoid type aliases that will be confusing to

readers of your code. Prefer type aliases that represent something, rather than repre‐

senting something or null or undefined.

**Things to Remember**

- Avoid defining type aliases that include null or undefined.

```
Item 32: Avoid Including null or undefined in Type Aliases | 149
```

### Item 33: Push Null Values to the Perimeter of Your Types

When you first turn on strictNullChecks, it may seem as though you have to add

scores of if statements checking for null and undefined values throughout your

code. This is often because the relationships between null and non-null values are

implicit: when variable A is non-null, you know that variable B is also non-null and

vice versa. These implicit relationships are confusing both for human readers of your

code and for the type checker.

Values are easier to work with when they’re either completely null or completely non-

null, rather than a mix. You can model this by pushing the null values out to the

perimeter of your structures.

Suppose you want to calculate the min and max of a list of numbers. We’ll call this the

“extent.” Here’s an attempt:

```
// @strictNullChecks: false
function extent(nums: Iterable< number >) {
let min, max;
for ( const num of nums) {
if (!min) {
min = num;
max = num;
} else {
min = Math.min(min, num);
max = Math.max(max, num);
}
}
return [min, max];
}
```
The code type checks (without strictNullChecks) and has an inferred return type of

number[], which seems fine. But it has a bug and a design flaw:

- If the min or max is zero, it may get overridden. For example, extent([0, 1,
    2]) will return [1, 2] rather than [0, 2].
- If the nums array is empty, the function will return [undefined, undefined].

This sort of object with several undefineds will be difficult for clients to work with

and is exactly the sort of type that this item discourages. We know from reading the

source code that either both min and max will be undefined or neither will be, but that

information isn’t represented in the type system.

**150 | Chapter 4: Type Design**


Turning on strictNullChecks makes the issue with undefined more apparent:

```
function extent(nums: Iterable< number >) {
let min, max;
for ( const num of nums) {
if (!min) {
min = num;
max = num;
} else {
min = Math.min(min, num);
max = Math.max(max, num);
// ~~~ Argument of type 'number | undefined' is not
// assignable to parameter of type 'number'
}
}
return [min, max];
}
```
The return type of extent is now inferred as (number | undefined)[], which makes

the design flaw more apparent. This is likely to manifest as a type error wherever you

call extent:

```
const [min, max] = extent([0, 1, 2]);
const span = max - min;
// ~~~ ~~~ Object is possibly 'undefined'
```
The error in the implementation of extent comes about because you’ve excluded

undefined as a value for min but not max. The two are initialized together, but this

information isn’t present in the type system. You could make it go away by adding a

check for max, too, but this would be doubling down on the bug.

A better solution is to put min and max in the same object and make this object either

fully null or fully non-null:

```
function extent(nums: Iterable< number >) {
let minMax: [ number , number ] | null = null ;
for ( const num of nums) {
if (!minMax) {
minMax = [num, num];
} else {
const [oldMin, oldMax] = minMax;
minMax = [Math.min(num, oldMin), Math.max(num, oldMax)];
}
}
return minMax;
}
```
```
Item 33: Push Null Values to the Perimeter of Your Types | 151
```

The return type is now [number, number] | null, which is easier for clients to work

with. min and max can be retrieved with either a non-null assertion:

```
const [min, max] = extent([0, 1, 2])!;
const span = max - min; // OK
```
or a single check:

```
const range = extent([0, 1, 2]);
if (range) {
const [min, max] = range;
const span = max - min; // OK
}
```
By using a single object to track the extent, we’ve improved our design, helped Type‐

Script understand the relationship between null values, and fixed the bug: the

if (!minMax) check is now problem free.

(A next step might be to prevent passing non-empty lists to extent, which would

remove the possibility of returning null altogether. Item 64 presents a way you might

represent a non-empty list in TypeScript’s type system.)

A mix of null and non-null values can also lead to problems in classes. For instance,

suppose you have a class that represents both a user and their posts on a forum:

```
class UserPosts {
user: UserInfo | null ;
posts: Post[] | null ;
```
```
constructor () {
this .user = null ;
this .posts = null ;
}
```
```
async init(userId: string ) {
return Promise.all([
async () => this .user = await fetchUser(userId),
async () => this .posts = await fetchPostsForUser(userId)
]);
}
```
```
getUserName() {
// ...?
}
}
```
While the two network requests are loading, the user and posts properties will be

null. At any time, they might both be null, one might be null, or they might both be

non-null. There are four possibilities. This complexity will seep into every method

on the class. This design is almost certain to lead to confusion, a proliferation of null

checks, and bugs.

**152 | Chapter 4: Type Design**


A better design would wait until all the data used by the class is available:

```
class UserPosts {
user: UserInfo;
posts: Post[];
```
```
constructor (user: UserInfo, posts: Post[]) {
this .user = user;
this .posts = posts;
}
```
```
static async init(userId: string ): Promise<UserPosts> {
const [user, posts] = await Promise.all([
fetchUser(userId),
fetchPostsForUser(userId)
]);
return new UserPosts(user, posts);
}
```
```
getUserName() {
return this .user.name;
}
}
```
Now the UserPosts class is fully non-null, and it’s easy to write correct methods on

it. Of course, if you need to perform operations while data is partially loaded, then

you’ll need to deal with the multiplicity of null and non-null states.

Don’t be tempted to replace nullable properties with Promises. This tends to lead to

even more confusing code and forces all your methods to be async. Promises clarify

the code that loads data but tend to have the opposite effect on the class that uses that

data.

**Things to Remember**

- Avoid designs in which one value being null or not null is implicitly related to
    another value being null or not null.
- Push null values to the perimeter of your API by making larger objects either
    null or fully non-null. This will make code clearer both for human readers and
    for the type checker.
- Consider creating a fully non-null class and constructing it when all values are
    available.

```
Item 33: Push Null Values to the Perimeter of Your Types | 153
```

### Item 34: Prefer Unions of Interfaces to Interfaces with Unions

If you create an interface whose properties are union types, you should ask whether

the type would make more sense as a union of more precise interfaces.

Suppose you’re building a vector drawing program and want to define an interface for

layers with specific geometry types:

```
interface Layer {
layout: FillLayout | LineLayout | PointLayout;
paint: FillPaint | LinePaint | PointPaint;
}
```
The layout field controls how and where the shapes are drawn (rounded corners?

straight?), while the paint field controls styles (is the line blue? thick? thin? dashed?).

The intention is that a Layer will have matching layout and paint properties. A Fill

Layout should go with a FillPaint, and a LineLayout should go with a LinePaint.

But this version of the Layer type also allows a FillLayout with a LinePaint. This

possibility makes using the library more error prone and makes this interface difficult

to work with.

A better way to model this is with separate interfaces for each type of layer:

```
interface FillLayer {
layout: FillLayout;
paint: FillPaint;
}
interface LineLayer {
layout: LineLayout;
paint: LinePaint;
}
interface PointLayer {
layout: PointLayout;
paint: PointPaint;
}
type Layer = FillLayer | LineLayer | PointLayer;
```
By defining Layer in this way, you’ve excluded the possibility of mixed layout and

paint properties. This is an example of following Item 29’s advice to prefer types that

only represent valid states.

By far the most common example of this pattern is the “tagged union” (or “discrimi‐

nated union”). In this case, one of the properties is a union of string literal types:

**154 | Chapter 4: Type Design**


```
interface Layer {
type : 'fill' | 'line' | 'point';
layout: FillLayout | LineLayout | PointLayout;
paint: FillPaint | LinePaint | PointPaint;
}
```
As before, would it make sense to have type: 'fill' but then a LineLayout and

PointPaint? Certainly not. Convert Layer to a union of interfaces to exclude this

possibility:

```
interface FillLayer {
type : 'fill';
layout: FillLayout;
paint: FillPaint;
}
interface LineLayer {
type : 'line';
layout: LineLayout;
paint: LinePaint;
}
interface PointLayer {
type : 'paint';
layout: PointLayout;
paint: PointPaint;
}
type Layer = FillLayer | LineLayer | PointLayer;
```
The type property is the “tag” or “discriminant.” It can be accessed at runtime and

gives TypeScript just enough information to determine which element of the union

type you’re working with. Here, TypeScript is able to narrow the type of Layer in an

if statement based on the tag:

```
function drawLayer(layer: Layer) {
if (layer. type === 'fill') {
const {paint} = layer;
// ^? const paint: FillPaint
const {layout} = layer;
// ^? const layout: FillLayout
} else if (layer. type === 'line') {
const {paint} = layer;
// ^? const paint: LinePaint
const {layout} = layer;
// ^? const layout: LineLayout
} else {
const {paint} = layer;
// ^? const paint: PointPaint
const {layout} = layer;
// ^? const layout: PointLayout
}
}
```
```
Item 34: Prefer Unions of Interfaces to Interfaces with Unions | 155
```

By correctly modeling the relationship between the properties in this type, you help

TypeScript check your code’s correctness. The same code involving the initial Layer

definition would have been cluttered with type assertions.

Because they work so well with TypeScript’s type checker, tagged unions are ubiqui‐

tous in TypeScript code. Recognize this pattern and apply it when you can. If you can

represent a data type in TypeScript with a tagged union, it’s usually a good idea to

do so.

If you think of optional fields as a union of their type and undefined, then they fit the

“interface of unions” pattern as well. Consider this type:

```
interface Person {
name: string ;
// These will either both be present or not be present
placeOfBirth?: string ;
dateOfBirth?: Date;
}
```
As Item 31 explained, the comment with type information is a strong sign that there

might be a problem. There is a relationship between the placeOfBirth and dateOf

Birth fields that you haven’t told TypeScript about.

A better way to model this is to move both of these properties into a single object.

This is akin to moving null values to the perimeter (Item 33):

```
interface Person {
name: string ;
birth?: {
place: string ;
date: Date;
}
}
```
Now TypeScript complains about values with a place but no date of birth:

```
const alanT: Person = {
name: 'Alan Turing',
birth: {
// ~~~~ Property 'date' is missing in type
// '{ place: string; }' but required in type
// '{ place: string; date: Date; }'
place: 'London'
}
}
```
Additionally, a function that takes a Person object only needs to do a single check:

```
function eulogize(person: Person ) {
console.log(person.name);
const {birth} = person;
if (birth) {
```
**156 | Chapter 4: Type Design**


```
console.log(`was born on ${birth.date} in ${birth.place}.`);
}
}
```
If the structure of the type is outside your control (perhaps it’s coming from an API),

then you can still model the relationship between these fields using a now-familiar

union of interfaces:

```
interface Name {
name: string ;
}
```
```
interface PersonWithBirth extends Name {
placeOfBirth: string ;
dateOfBirth: Date;
}
```
```
type Person = Name | PersonWithBirth;
```
Now you get some of the same benefits as with the nested object:

```
function eulogize(person: Person ) {
if ('placeOfBirth' in person) {
person
// ^? (parameter) person: PersonWithBirth
const {dateOfBirth} = person; // OK
// ^? const dateOfBirth: Date
}
}
```
In both cases, the type definition makes the relationship between the properties more

clear.

While optional properties are often useful, you should think twice before adding one

to an interface. Item 37 explores more of the downsides of optional fields.

**Things to Remember**

- Interfaces with multiple properties that are union types are often a mistake
    because they obscure the relationships between these properties.
- Unions of interfaces are more precise and can be understood by TypeScript.
- Use tagged unions to facilitate control flow analysis. Because they are so well sup‐
    ported, this pattern is ubiquitous in TypeScript code.
- Consider whether multiple optional properties could be grouped to more accu‐
    rately model your data.

```
Item 34: Prefer Unions of Interfaces to Interfaces with Unions | 157
```

### Item 35: Prefer More Precise Alternatives to String Types

Recall from Item 7 that the domain of a type is the set of values assignable to that

type. The domain of the string type is enormous: "x" and "y" are in it, but so is the

complete text of Moby Dick (it starts with "Call me Ishmael..." and is about 1.2 mil‐

lion characters long). When you declare a variable of type string, you should ask

whether a narrower type would be more appropriate.

Suppose you’re building a music collection and want to define a type for an album.

Here’s an attempt:

```
interface Album {
artist: string ;
title: string ;
releaseDate: string ; // YYYY-MM-DD
recordingType: string ; // E.g., "live" or "studio"
}
```
The prevalence of string types and the type information in comments (Item 31) are

strong indications that this interface isn’t quite right. Here’s what can go wrong:

```
const kindOfBlue: Album = {
artist: 'Miles Davis',
title: 'Kind of Blue',
releaseDate: 'August 17th, 1959', // Oops!
recordingType: 'Studio', // Oops!
}; // OK
```
The releaseDate field is incorrectly formatted (according to the comment) and

'Studio' is capitalized where it should be lowercase. But these values are both

strings, so this object is assignable to Album and the type checker doesn’t complain.

These broad string types can mask errors for valid Album objects, too. For example:

```
function recordRelease(title: string , date: string ) { /* ... */ }
recordRelease(kindOfBlue.releaseDate, kindOfBlue.title); // OK, should be error
```
The parameters are reversed in the call to recordRelease but both are strings, so the

type checker doesn’t complain. Because of the prevalence of string types, code like

this is sometimes called “stringly typed.” (Item 38 explores how repeated positional

parameters of any type can be problematic, not just string.)

Can you make the types narrower to prevent these sorts of issues? While the com‐

plete text of Moby Dick would be a ponderous artist name or album title, it’s at least

plausible. So string is appropriate for these fields. For the releaseDate field, it’s bet‐

ter to use a Date object and avoid issues around formatting. Finally, for the record

ingType field, you can define a union type with just two values (you could also use an

enum, but I generally recommend avoiding these; see Item 72):

**158 | Chapter 4: Type Design**


```
type RecordingType = 'studio' | 'live';
```
```
interface Album {
artist: string ;
title: string ;
releaseDate: Date;
recordingType: RecordingType;
}
```
With these changes, TypeScript is able to do a more thorough check for errors:

```
const kindOfBlue: Album = {
artist: 'Miles Davis',
title: 'Kind of Blue',
releaseDate: new Date('1959-08-17'),
recordingType: 'Studio'
// ~~~~~~~~~~~~ Type '"Studio"' is not assignable to type 'RecordingType'
};
```
There are advantages to this approach beyond stricter checking. First, explicitly

defining the type ensures that its meaning won’t get lost as it’s passed around. If you

wanted to find albums of just a certain recording type, for instance, you might define

a function like this:

```
function getAlbumsOfType(recordingType: string ): Album[] {
// ...
}
```
How does the caller of this function know what recordingType is expected to be? It’s

just a string. The comment explaining that it’s 'studio' or 'live' is hidden in the

definition of Album, where the user might not think to look.

Second, explicitly defining a type allows you to attach documentation to it (see

Item 68):

```
/** What type of environment was this recording made in? */
type RecordingType = 'live' | 'studio';
```
When you change getAlbumsOfType to take a RecordingType, the caller is able to

click through and see the documentation (see Figure 4-1).

Figure 4-1. Using a named type instead of _string_ makes it possible to attach documen‐

tation to the type that is surfaced in your editor.

```
Item 35: Prefer More Precise Alternatives to String Types | 159
```

Another common misuse of string is in function parameters. Say you want to write

a function that pulls out all the values for a single field in an array. The Underscore

and Ramda utility libraries call this pluck:

```
function pluck(records, key) {
return records.map(r => r[key]);
}
```
How would you type this? Here’s an initial attempt:

```
function pluck(records: any [], key: string ): any [] {
return records.map(r => r[key]);
}
```
This type checks but isn’t great. The any types are problematic, particularly on the

return value (see Item 43). The first step to improving the type signature is introduc‐

ing a generic type parameter:

```
function pluck<T>(records: T[], key: string ): any [] {
return records.map(r => r[key]);
// ~~~~~~ Element implicitly has an 'any' type
// because type '{}' has no index signature
}
```
TypeScript is now complaining that the string type for key is too broad. And it’s

right to do so: if you pass in an array of Albums then there are only four valid values

for key (“artist,” “title,” “releaseDate,” and “recordingType”), as opposed to the vast set

of strings. This is precisely what the keyof Album type is:

```
type K = keyof Album;
// ^? type K = keyof Album
// (equivalent to "artist" | "title" | "releaseDate" | "recordingType")
```
So the fix is to replace string with keyof T:

```
function pluck<T>(records: T[], key: keyof T) {
return records.map(r => r[key]);
}
```
This passes the type checker. We’ve also let TypeScript infer the return type. How

does it do? If you mouse over pluck in your editor, the inferred type is:

```
function pluck<T>(record: T[], key: keyof T): T[ keyof T][];
```
T[keyof T] is the type of any possible value in T. If you’re passing in a single string as

the key, this is too broad. For example:

```
const releaseDates = pluck(albums, 'releaseDate');
// ^? const releaseDates: (string | Date)[]
```
**160 | Chapter 4: Type Design**


The type should be Date[], not (string | Date)[]. While keyof T is much nar‐

rower than string, it’s still too broad. To narrow it further, we need to introduce a

second type parameter that is a subtype of keyof T (probably a single value):

```
function pluck<T, K extends keyof T>(records: T[], key: K): T[K][] {
return records.map(r => r[key]);
}
```
The type signature is now completely correct. We can check this by calling pluck in a

few different ways:

```
const dates = pluck(albums, 'releaseDate');
// ^? const dates: Date[]
const artists = pluck(albums, 'artist');
// ^? const artists: string[]
const types = pluck(albums, 'recordingType');
// ^? const types: RecordingType[]
const mix = pluck(albums, Math.random() < 0.5? 'releaseDate' : 'artist');
// ^? const mix: (string | Date)[]
const badDates = pluck(albums, 'recordingDate');
// ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
// Argument of type '"recordingDate"' is not assignable to parameter of type ...
```
The language service is even able to offer autocomplete on the keys of Album (as

shown in Figure 4-2).

Figure 4-2. Using a parameter type of _keyof Album_ instead of _string_ results in better

autocomplete in your editor.

string has some of the same problems as any: when used inappropriately, it permits

invalid values and hides relationships between types. This thwarts the type checker

and can hide real bugs. TypeScript’s ability to define subsets of string is a powerful

way to bring type safety to JavaScript code. Using more precise types will both catch

errors and improve the readability of your code.

This item focused on finite sets of strings, but TypeScript also lets you model infinite

sets, for example, all the strings that start with “http:”. For these, you’ll want to use

template literal types, which are the subject of Item 54.

```
Item 35: Prefer More Precise Alternatives to String Types | 161
```

**Things to Remember**

- Avoid “stringly typed” code. Prefer more appropriate types where not every
    string is a possibility.
- Prefer a union of string literal types to string if that more accurately describes
    the domain of a variable. You’ll get stricter type checking and improve the devel‐
    opment experience.
- Prefer keyof T to string for function parameters that are expected to be proper‐
    ties of an object.

### Item 36: Use a Distinct Type for Special Values

JavaScript’s string split method is a handy way to break a string around a delimiter:

```
> 'abcde'.split('c')
[ 'ab', 'de' ]
```
Let’s write something like split, but for arrays. Here’s an attempt:

```
function splitAround<T>(vals: readonly T[], val: T): [T[], T[]] {
const index = vals.indexOf(val);
return [vals.slice(0, index), vals.slice(index+1)];
}
```
This works as you’d expect:

```
> splitAround([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3)
[ [ 1, 2 ], [ 4, 5 ] ]
```
If you try to splitAround an element that’s not in the list, however, it does something

quite unexpected:

```
> splitAround([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 6)
[ [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ], [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ] ]
```
While it’s not entirely clear what the function should do in this case, it’s definitely not

that! How did such simple code result in such strange behavior?

The root issue is that indexOf returns -1 if it can’t find the element in the array. This

is a special value: it indicates a failure rather than success. But -1 is just an ordinary

number. You can pass it to the Array slice method and you can do arithmetic on it.

When you pass a negative number to slice, it interprets it as counting back from the

end of the array. And when you add 1 to -1, you get 0. So this evaluates as:

```
[vals.slice(0, -1), vals.slice(0)]
```
The first slice returns all but the last element of the array, and the second slice

returns a complete copy of the array.

**162 | Chapter 4: Type Design**


This behavior is a bug. Moreover, it’s unfortunate that TypeScript wasn’t able to help

us find this problem. The root issue was that indexOf returned -1 when it couldn’t

find the element, rather than, say null. Why is that?

Without hopping in a time machine and visiting the Netscape offices in 1995, it’s hard

to know the answer for sure. But we can speculate! JavaScript was heavily influenced

by Java, and its indexOf has this same behavior. In Java (and C), a function can’t

return a primitive or null. Only objects (or pointers) are nullable. So this behavior

may derive from a technical limitation in Java that JavaScript does not share.

In JavaScript (and TypeScript), there’s no problem having a function return a number

or null. So we can wrap indexOf:

```
function safeIndexOf<T>(vals: readonly T[], val: T): number | null {
const index = vals.indexOf(val);
return index === -1? null : index;
}
```
If we plug that into our original definition of splitAround, we immediately get two

type errors:

```
function splitAround<T>(vals: readonly T[], val: T): [T[], T[]] {
const index = safeIndexOf(vals, val);
return [vals.slice(0, index), vals.slice(index+1)];
// ~~~~~ ~~~~~ 'index' is possibly 'null'
}
```
This is exactly what we want! There are always two cases to consider with indexOf.

With the built-in version, TypeScript can’t distinguish them, but with the wrapped

version, it can. And it sees here that we’ve only considered the case where the array

contained the value.

The solution is to handle the other case explicitly:

```
function splitAround<T>(vals: readonly T[], val: T): [T[], T[]] {
const index = safeIndexOf(vals, val);
if (index === null ) {
return [[...vals], []];
}
return [vals.slice(0, index), vals.slice(index+1)]; // ok
}
```
Whether this is the right behavior is debatable, but at least TypeScript has forced us to

have that debate!

The root problem with the first implementation was that indexOf had two distinct

cases, but the return value in the special case (-1) had the same type as the return

value in the regular case (number). This meant that from TypeScript’s perspective

there was just a single case, and it wasn’t able to detect that we didn’t check for -1.

```
Item 36: Use a Distinct Type for Special Values | 163
```

This situation comes up frequently when you’re designing types. Perhaps you have a

type for describing merchandise:

```
interface Product {
title: string ;
priceDollars: number ;
}
```
Then you realize that some products have an unknown price. Making this field

optional or changing it to number|null might require a migration and lots of code

changes, so instead you introduce a special value:

```
interface Product {
title: string ;
/** Price of the product in dollars, or -1 if price is unknown */
priceDollars: number ;
}
```
You ship it to production. A week later your boss is irate and wants to know why

you’ve been crediting money to customer cards. Your team works to roll back the

change and you’re tasked with writing the postmortem. In retrospect, it would have

been much easier to deal with those type errors!

Choosing in-domain special values like -1, 0 , or "" is similar in spirit to turning off

strictNullChecks. When strictNullChecks is off, you can assign null or

undefined to any type:

```
// @strictNullChecks: false
const truck: Product = {
title: 'Tesla Cybertruck',
priceDollars: null , // ok
};
```
This lets a huge class of bugs slip through the type checker because TypeScript doesn’t

distinguish between number and number|null. null is a valid value in all types. When

you enable strictNullChecks, TypeScript does distinguish between these types and

it’s able to detect a whole host of new problems. When you choose an in-domain spe‐

cial value like -1, you’re effectively carving out a non-strict niche in your types. Expe‐

dient, yes, but ultimately not the best choice.

null and undefined may not always be the right way to represent special cases since

their exact meaning may be context dependent. If you’re modeling the state of a net‐

work request, for example, it would be a bad idea to use null to mean an error state

and undefined to mean a pending state. Better to use a tagged union to represent

these special states more explicitly. Item 29 explores this example in more detail.

**164 | Chapter 4: Type Design**


**Things to Remember**

- Avoid special values that are assignable to regular values in a type. They will
    reduce TypeScript’s ability to find bugs in your code.
- Prefer null or undefined as a special value instead of 0 , -1, or "".
- Consider using a tagged union rather than null or undefined if the meaning of
    those values isn’t clear.

### Item 37: Limit the Use of Optional Properties

As your types evolve, you’ll inevitably want to add new properties to them. To avoid

invalidating existing code or data, you might choose to make these properties

optional. While this is sometimes the right choice, optional properties do come at a

cost and you should think twice before adding them.

Imagine you have a UI component that displays numbers with a label and units.

Think “Height: 12 ft” or “Speed: 10 mph”:

```
interface FormattedValue {
value: number ;
units: string ;
}
function formatValue(value: FormattedValue) { /* ... */ }
```
You build a big web application using this component. Perhaps part of it displays for‐

matted information about a hike you’ve taken (“5 miles at 2 mph”):

```
interface Hike {
miles: number ;
hours: number ;
}
function formatHike({miles, hours}: Hike) {
const distanceDisplay = formatValue({value: miles, units: 'miles'});
const paceDisplay = formatValue({value: miles / hours, units: 'mph'});
return `${distanceDisplay} at ${paceDisplay}`;
}
```
One day you learn about the metric system and decide to support it. To support both

metric and imperial, you add a corresponding option to FormattedValue. If needed,

the component will do a unit conversion before displaying the value. To minimize

changes to existing code and tests, you decide to make the property optional:

```
type UnitSystem = 'metric' | 'imperial';
interface FormattedValue {
value: number ;
units: string ;
/** default is imperial */
unitSystem?: UnitSystem;
}
```
```
Item 37: Limit the Use of Optional Properties | 165
```

To let the user configure this, we’ll also want to specify a unit system in our app-wide

configuration:

```
interface AppConfig {
darkMode: boolean ;
// ... other settings ...
/** default is imperial */
unitSystem?: UnitSystem;
}
```
Now we can update formatHike to support the metric system:

```
function formatHike({miles, hours}: Hike, config: AppConfig) {
const { unitSystem } = config;
const distanceDisplay = formatValue({
value: miles, units: 'miles', unitSystem
});
const paceDisplay = formatValue({
value: miles / hours, units: 'mph' // forgot unitSystem, oops!
});
return `${distanceDisplay} at ${paceDisplay}`;
}
```
We set unitSystem in one call to formatValue but not the other. This is a bug that

means our metric users will see a mix of imperial and metric units.

In fact, our design is a recipe for exactly this sort of bug. In every place that we use

the formatValue component, we need to remember to pass in a unitSystem. When‐

ever we don’t, metric users will see confusing imperial units like yards, acres, or foot-

pounds.

It would be nice if there were a way to automatically find every place where we forgot

to pass in a unitSystem. This is exactly the sort of thing that type checking is good at,

but we’ve kept it from helping us by making the unitSystem property optional.

If you make it required instead, you’ll get a type error everywhere you forgot to set it.

You’ll have to fix these one by one, but it’s much better to have TypeScript find these

mistakes than to hear about them from confused users!

The “default is imperial” documentation comment is also worrisome. In TypeScript,

the default value of an optional property on an object is always undefined. To imple‐

ment an alternative default, our code is likely to be littered with lines like this:

```
declare let config: AppConfig;
const unitSystem = config.unitSystem ?? 'imperial';
```
Every one of these is an opportunity for a bug. Perhaps another developer on your

team forgets that imperial is the default (why is it the default anyway?) and assumes it

should be metric:

```
const unitSystem = config.unitSystem ?? 'metric';
```
**166 | Chapter 4: Type Design**


Once again the result will be inconsistent display.

If you need to support old values of the AppConfig interface (perhaps they’re saved as

JSON on disk or in a database) then you can’t make the new field required. What you

can do instead is split the type in two: one type for un-normalized configurations

read from disk, and another with fewer optional properties for use in your app:

```
interface InputAppConfig {
darkMode: boolean ;
// ... other settings ...
/** default is imperial */
unitSystem?: UnitSystem;
}
interface AppConfig extends InputAppConfig {
unitSystem: UnitSystem; // required
}
```
If changing an optional property to required in a subtype feels strange, see Item 7.

You could also use Required<InputAppConfig> here.

You’ll want to add some normalization code:

```
function normalizeAppConfig(inputConfig: InputAppConfig): AppConfig {
return {
...inputConfig,
unitSystem: inputConfig.unitSystem ?? 'imperial',
};
}
```
This split solves a few problems:

1. It allows the config to evolve and maintain backward compatibility without
    adding complexity throughout the application.
2. It centralizes the application of default values.
3. It makes it hard to use an InputAppConfig where an AppConfig is expected.

These sorts of “under construction” types come up frequently with network code. See

UserPosts in Item 33 for another example.

As you add more optional properties to an interface, you’ll run into a new problem:

if you have N optional properties then there are 2N possible combinations of them.

That’s a lot of possibilities! If you have 10 optional properties, have you tested all

1,024 combinations? Do all the combinations even make sense? It’s likely that there’s

some structure to these options, perhaps some that are mutually exclusive. If so, then

your state should model this (see Item 29). This is a problem with options in general,

not just optional properties.

Finally, optional properties are a possible source of unsoundness in TypeScript. Item

48 discusses this in more detail.

```
Item 37: Limit the Use of Optional Properties | 167
```

As you’ve seen, there are lots of reasons to avoid optional properties. So when should

you use them? They’re largely unavoidable when describing existing APIs or evolving

APIs while maintaining backward compatibility. For huge configurations, it may be

prohibitively expensive to fill in all optional fields with default values. And some

properties truly are optional: not everyone has a middle name, so an optional middle

Name property on a Person type is an accurate model. But be aware of the many draw‐

backs of optional properties, know how to mitigate them, and think twice before

adding an optional property if there’s a valid alternative.

**Things to Remember**

- Optional properties can prevent the type checker from finding bugs and can lead
    to repeated and possibly inconsistent code for filling in default values.
- Think twice before adding an optional property to an interface. Consider
    whether you could make it required instead.
- Consider creating distinct types for un-normalized input data and normalized
    data for use in your code.
- Avoid a combinatorial explosion of options.

### Item 38: Avoid Repeated Parameters of the Same Type

What does this function call do?

```
drawRect(25, 50, 75, 100, 1);
```
Without looking at the function’s parameter list, it’s impossible to say. Here are a few

possibilities:

- It draws a 75 × 100 rectangle with its top left at (25, 50) with an opacity of 1.0.
- It draws a 50 × 50 rectangle with corners at (25, 50) and (75, 100), with a stroke
    width of one pixel.

Without more context, it’s hard to know whether this function is being called cor‐

rectly. And because all the parameters are of the same type, number, the type checker

won’t be able to help you if you mix up the order or pass in a width and height instead

of a second coordinate.

Suppose this was the function declaration:

```
function drawRect(x: number , y: number , w: number , h: number , opacity: number ) {
// ...
}
```
**168 | Chapter 4: Type Design**


Any function that takes consecutive parameters of the same type is error prone

because the type checker won’t be able to catch incorrect invocations. One way to

improve the situation would be to take in distinct Point and Dimension types:

```
interface Point {
x: number ;
y: number ;
}
interface Dimension {
width: number ;
height: number ;
}
function drawRect(topLeft: Point, size: Dimension, opacity: number ) {
// ...
}
```
Because the function now takes three parameters with three different types, the type

checker is able to distinguish between them. An incorrect invocation that passes in

two points will be an error:

```
drawRect({x: 25, y: 50}, {x: 75, y: 100}, 1.0);
// ~
// Argument ... is not assignable to parameter of type 'Dimension'.
```
An alternative fix would be to combine all the parameters into a single object:

```
interface DrawRectParams extends Point, Dimension {
opacity: number ;
}
function drawRect(params: DrawRectParams) { /* ... */ }
```
```
drawRect({x: 25, y: 50, width: 75, height: 100, opacity: 1.0});
```
Refactoring a function to take an object rather than positional parameters improves

clarity for human readers. And, by associating names with each number, it helps the

type checker catch incorrect invocations as well.

As your code evolves, functions may be modified to take more and more parameters.

Even if positional parameters worked well at first, at some point they will become a

problem. As the saying goes, “If you have a function with 10 parameters, you proba‐

bly missed some.” Once a function takes more than three or four parameters, you

should refactor it to take fewer. (typescript-eslint’s max-params rule can enforce this.)

When the types of the parameters are the same, you should be even more wary of

positional parameters. Even two parameters might be a problem.

```
Item 38: Avoid Repeated Parameters of the Same Type | 169
```

There are a few exceptions to this rule:

- If the arguments are commutative (the order doesn’t matter), then there’s no
    problem. max(a, b) and isEqual(a, b), for example, are unambiguous.
- If there’s a “natural” order to the parameters, then the potential for confusion is
    reduced. array.slice(start, stop) makes more sense than stop, start, for
    example. Be careful with this, though: developers might not always agree what a
    “natural” order is. (Is it year, month, day? Month, day, year? Day, month, year?)

As Scott Meyers wrote in Effective C++, “Make interfaces easy to use correctly and

hard to use incorrectly.” It’s hard to argue with that!

**Things to Remember**

- Avoid writing functions that take consecutive parameters with the same Type‐
    Script type.
- Refactor functions that take many parameters to take fewer parameters with dis‐
    tinct types, or a single object parameter.

### Item 39: Prefer Unifying Types to Modeling Differences

TypeScript’s type system gives you powerful tools to map between types. Item 15 and

Chapter 6 explain how to use many of them. Once you realize that you can model a

transformation using the type system, you may feel an overwhelming urge to do so.

And this will feel productive. So many types! So much safety!

If it’s available to you, though, a better option than modeling the difference between

two types is to eliminate the difference between those two types. Then no type-level

machinery is required, and the cognitive burden of keeping track of which version of

a type you’re working with goes away.

To make this more concrete, imagine you have an interface that derives from a data‐

base table. Databases typically use snake_case for column names, so this is how your

data comes out:

```
interface StudentTable {
first_name: string ;
last_name: string ;
birth_date: string ;
}
```
TypeScript code typically uses camelCase property names. To make the Student type

more consistent with the rest of your code, you might introduce an alternate version

of Student:

**170 | Chapter 4: Type Design**


```
interface Student {
firstName: string ;
lastName: string ;
birthDate: string ;
}
```
You can write a function to convert between these two types. More interestingly, you

can use template literal types to type this function. Item 54 walks through how to do

this, but the end result is that you can generate one type from the other:

```
type Student = ObjectToCamel<StudentTable>;
// ^? type Student = {
// firstName: string;
// lastName: string;
// birthDate: string;
// }
```
Amazing! After the thrill of finding a compelling use case for fancy type-level pro‐

gramming wears off, you may find yourself running into lots of errors from passing

one version of the type to a function that’s expecting the other:

```
async function writeStudentToDb(student: Student) {
await writeRowToDb(db, 'students', student);
// ~~~~~~~
// Type 'Student' is not assignable to parameter of type 'StudentTable'.
}
```
It’s not obvious from the error message, but the problem is that you’ve forgotten to

call your conversion code:

```
async function writeStudentToDb(student: Student) {
await writeRowToDb(db, 'students', objectToSnake(student)); // ok
}
```
While it’s helpful that TypeScript flagged this mistake before it caused a runtime

error, it would be simpler to have just a single version of the Student type in your

code so that this error is impossible to make.

There are two versions of the Student type. Which should you choose?

- To adopt the camelCase version, you’ll need to set up some kind of adapter to
    make sure your database returns camelCased version of the columns. You’ll also
    need to make sure that whatever tool you use to generate TypeScript types from
    your database knows about this transformation. The advantage of this approach
    is that your database interfaces will look just like all your other types.
- To adopt the snake_case version, you don’t need to do anything at all. You just
    need to accept a superficial inconsistency in the naming convention for a deeper
    consistency in your types.

Either of these approaches is feasible, but the latter is simpler.

```
Item 39: Prefer Unifying Types to Modeling Differences | 171
```

The general principle is that you should prefer unifying types to modeling small dif‐

ferences between them. That being said, there are some caveats to this rule.

First, unification isn’t always an option. You may need the two types if the database

and the API aren’t under your control. If this is the case, then modeling these sorts of

differences systematically in the type system will help you find bugs in your transfor‐

mation code. It’s better than creating types ad hoc and hoping they stay in sync.

Second, don’t unify types that aren’t actually representing the same thing! “Unifying”

the different types in a tagged union would be counterproductive, for example,

because they presumably represent different states that you want to keep separate.

**Things to Remember**

- Having distinct variants of the same type creates cognitive overhead and requires
    lots of conversion code.
- Rather than modeling slight variations on a type in your code, try to eliminate
    the variation so that you can unify to a single type.
- Unifying types may require some adjustments to runtime code.
- If the types aren’t in your control, you may need to model the variations.
- Don’t unify types that aren’t representing the same thing.

### Item 40: Prefer Imprecise Types to Inaccurate Types

In writing type declarations you’ll inevitably find situations where you can model

behavior in a more precise or less precise way. Precision in types is generally a

good thing because it will help your users catch bugs and take advantage of the tool‐

ing that TypeScript provides. But take care as you increase the precision of your type

declarations: it’s easy to make mistakes, and incorrect types can be worse than no

types at all.

Suppose you are writing type declarations for GeoJSON, a format we’ve seen before in

Item 33. A GeoJSON geometry can be one of a few types, each of which has differ‐

ently shaped coordinate arrays:

```
interface Point {
type : 'Point';
coordinates: number [];
}
interface LineString {
type : 'LineString';
coordinates: number [][];
}
interface Polygon {
type : 'Polygon';
```
**172 | Chapter 4: Type Design**


```
coordinates: number [][][];
}
type Geometry = Point | LineString | Polygon; // Also several others
```
This is fine, but number[] for a coordinate is a bit imprecise. Really these are latitudes

and longitudes, so perhaps a tuple type would be better:

```
type GeoPosition = [ number , number ];
interface Point {
type : 'Point';
coordinates: GeoPosition;
}
// Etc.
```
You publish your more precise types to the world and wait for the adulation to roll in.

Unfortunately, a user complains that your new types have broken everything. Even

though you’ve only ever used latitude and longitude, a position in GeoJSON is

allowed to have a third element, an elevation, and potentially more. In an attempt to

make the type declarations more precise, you’ve gone too far and made the types

inaccurate! To continue using your type declarations, your user will have to introduce

type assertions or silence the type checker entirely with as any. Perhaps they’ll give

up and start writing their own declarations.

As another example, consider trying to write type declarations for a Lisp-like lan‐

guage defined in JSON:

```
12
"red"
["+", 1, 2] // 3
["/", 20, 2] // 10
["case", [">", 20, 10], "red", "blue"] // "red"
["rgb", 255, 0, 127] // "#FF007F"
```
The Mapbox library uses a system like this to determine the appearance of map fea‐

tures across many devices. There’s a whole spectrum of precision with which you

could try to type this:

1. Allow anything.
2. Allow strings, numbers, and arrays.
3. Allow strings, numbers, and arrays starting with known function names.
4. Make sure each function gets the correct number of arguments.
5. Make sure each function gets the correct type of arguments.

The first two options are straightforward:

```
type Expression1 = any ;
type Expression2 = number | string | any [];
```
```
Item 40: Prefer Imprecise Types to Inaccurate Types | 173
```

A type system is said to be “complete” if it allows all valid programs. These two types

will allow all valid Mapbox expressions. There will be no false positive errors. But

with such simple types there will be many false negatives: invalid expressions that

aren’t flagged as such. In other words, the types are not very precise.

Let’s see if we can improve the precision without losing the completeness property. To

avoid regressions, we should introduce a test set of expressions that are valid and

expressions that are not. (Item 55 is all about testing types.)

```
const okExpressions: Expression2[] = [
10,
"red",
["+", 10, 5],
["rgb", 255, 128, 64],
["case", [">", 20, 10], "red", "blue"],
];
const invalidExpressions: Expression2[] = [
true ,
// ~~~ Type 'boolean' is not assignable to type 'Expression2'
["**", 2, 31], // Should be an error: no "**" function
["rgb", 255, 0, 127, 0], // Should be an error: too many values
["case", [">", 20, 10], "red", "blue", "green"], // (Too many values)
];
```
To go to the next level of precision, you can use a union of string literal types as the

first element of a tuple:

```
type FnName = '+' | '-' | '*' | '/' | '>' | '<' | 'case' | 'rgb';
type CallExpression = [FnName, ... any []];
type Expression3 = number | string | CallExpression;
```
```
const okExpressions: Expression3[] = [
10,
"red",
["+", 10, 5],
["rgb", 255, 128, 64],
["case", [">", 20, 10], "red", "blue"],
];
const invalidExpressions: Expression3[] = [
true ,
// Error: Type 'boolean' is not assignable to type 'Expression3'
["**", 2, 31],
// ~~ Type '"**"' is not assignable to type 'FnName'
["rgb", 255, 0, 127, 0], // Should be an error: too many values
["case", [">", 20, 10], "red", "blue", "green"], // (Too many values)
];
```
There’s one new caught error and no regressions. Pretty good! One complication is

that our type declarations have become more closely related to our Mapbox version.

If Mapbox adds a new function, then the type declarations need to add it, too. These

types are more precise, but they’re also higher maintenance.

**174 | Chapter 4: Type Design**


What if you want to make sure that each function gets the correct number of

arguments? This gets trickier since the types now need to be recursive to reach down

into all the function calls. TypeScript allows this, though we do need to take some

care to convince the type checker that our recursion isn’t infinite. There are a few

ways to do this. One is to define CaseCall (which must be an array of even length)

with an interface rather than a type.

This is possible, if a bit awkward:

```
type Expression4 = number | string | CallExpression;
```
```
type CallExpression = MathCall | CaseCall | RGBCall;
```
```
type MathCall = [
'+' | '-' | '/' | '*' | '>' | '<',
Expression4,
Expression4,
];
```
```
interface CaseCall {
0: 'case';
[n: number ]: Expression4;
length: 4 | 6 | 8 | 10 | 12 | 14 | 16; // etc.
}
```
```
type RGBCall = ['rgb', Expression4, Expression4, Expression4];
```
Let’s see how we’ve done:

```
const okExpressions: Expression4[] = [
10,
"red",
["+", 10, 5],
["rgb", 255, 128, 64],
["case", [">", 20, 10], "red", "blue"],
];
const invalidExpressions: Expression4[] = [
true ,
// ~~~ Type 'boolean' is not assignable to type 'Expression4'
["**", 2, 31],
// ~~~~ Type '"**"' is not assignable to type '"+" | "-" | "/" | ...
["rgb", 255, 0, 127, 0],
// ~ Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'undefined'.
["case", [">", 20, 10], "red", "blue", "green"],
// ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
// Types of property 'length' are incompatible.
// Type '5' is not assignable to type '4 | 6 | 8 | 10 | 12 | 14 | 16'.
];
```
```
Item 40: Prefer Imprecise Types to Inaccurate Types | 175
```

Now all the invalid expressions produce errors. And it’s interesting that you can

express something like “an array of even length” using a TypeScript interface. But

some of these error messages are a bit confusing, particularly the one about

Type '5'.

Is this an improvement over the previous, less precise types? The fact that you get

errors for more incorrect usages is definitely a win, but confusing error messages will

make this type more difficult to work with. As Item 6 explained, language services are

as much a part of the TypeScript experience as type checking, so it’s a good idea to

look at the error messages resulting from your type declarations and try autocom‐

plete in situations where it should work. If your new type declarations are more pre‐

cise but break autocomplete, then they’ll make for a less enjoyable TypeScript

development experience.

The complexity of this type declaration has also increased the odds that a bug will

creep in. For example, Expression4 requires that all math operators take two param‐

eters, but the Mapbox expression spec says that + and * can take more. Also, - can

take a single parameter, in which case it negates its input. Expression4 incorrectly

flags errors in all of these:

```
const moreOkExpressions: Expression4[] = [
['-', 12],
// ~~~~~~ Type '["-", number]' is not assignable to type 'MathCall'.
// Source has 2 element(s) but target requires 3.
['+', 1, 2, 3],
// ~ Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'undefined'.
['*', 2, 3, 4],
// ~ Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'undefined'.
];
```
Once again, in trying to be more precise we’ve overshot and become inaccurate.

These inaccuracies can be corrected, but you’ll want to expand your test set to con‐

vince yourself that you haven’t missed anything else. Complex code generally requires

more tests, and the same is true of types.

As you refine types, it can be helpful to think of the “uncanny valley” metaphor. As a

cartoonish drawing becomes more true to life, we tend to perceive it as becoming

more realistic. But only up to a point. If it goes for too much realism, we tend to

hyperfocus on the few remaining inaccuracies.

In the same way, refining very imprecise types like any is almost always helpful. You

and your coworkers will perceive this as an improvement to type safety and produc‐

tivity. But as your types get more precise, the expectation that they’ll also be accurate

increases. You’ll start to trust the types to catch most errors, and so the inaccuracies

will stand out more starkly. If you spend hours tracking down a type error, only to

find that the types are inaccurate, it will undermine confidence in your type declara‐

tions and perhaps TypeScript itself. It certainly won’t boost your productivity!

**176 | Chapter 4: Type Design**


**Things to Remember**

- Avoid the uncanny valley of type safety: complex but inaccurate types are often
    worse than simpler, less precise types. If you cannot model a type accurately, do
    not model it inaccurately! Acknowledge the gaps using any or unknown.
- Pay attention to error messages and autocomplete as you make typings increas‐
    ingly precise. It’s not just about correctness: developer experience matters, too.
- As your types grow more complex, your test suite for them should expand.

### Item 41: Name Types Using the Language of Your Problem Domain

```
There are only two hard problems in Computer Science: cache invalidation and
naming things.
—Phil Karlton
```
This book has had much to say about the shape of types and the sets of values in their

domains, but much less about what you name your types. But this is an important

part of type design, too. Well-chosen type, property, and variable names can clarify

intent and raise the level of abstraction of your code and types. Poorly chosen types

can obscure your code and lead to incorrect mental models.

Suppose you’re building out a database of animals. You create an interface to repre‐

sent one:

```
interface Animal {
name: string ;
endangered: boolean ;
habitat: string ;
}
```
```
const leopard: Animal = {
name: 'Snow Leopard',
endangered: false ,
habitat: 'tundra',
};
```
There are a few issues here:

- name is a very general term. What sort of name are you expecting? A scientific
    name? A common name?
- The boolean endangered field is also ambiguous. What if an animal is extinct? Is
    the intent here “endangered or worse”? Or does it literally mean endangered?

```
Item 41: Name Types Using the Language of Your Problem Domain | 177
```

- The habitat field is very ambiguous, not just because of the overly broad string
    type (Item 35), but also because it’s unclear what’s meant by “habitat.”
- The variable name is leopard, but the value of the name property is “Snow Leop‐
    ard.” Is this distinction meaningful?

Here’s a type declaration and value with less ambiguity:

```
interface Animal {
commonName: string ;
genus: string ;
species: string ;
status: ConservationStatus;
climates: KoppenClimate[];
}
type ConservationStatus = 'EX' | 'EW' | 'CR' | 'EN' | 'VU' | 'NT' | 'LC';
type KoppenClimate = |
'Af' | 'Am' | 'As' | 'Aw' |
'BSh' | 'BSk' | 'BWh' | 'BWk' |
'Cfa' | 'Cfb' | 'Cfc' | 'Csa' | 'Csb' | 'Csc' | 'Cwa' | 'Cwb' | 'Cwc' |
'Dfa' | 'Dfb' | 'Dfc' | 'Dfd' |
'Dsa' | 'Dsb' | 'Dsc' | 'Dwa' | 'Dwb' | 'Dwc' | 'Dwd' |
'EF' | 'ET';
const snowLeopard: Animal = {
commonName: 'Snow Leopard',
genus: 'Panthera',
species: 'Uncia',
status: 'VU', // vulnerable
climates: ['ET', 'EF', 'Dfd'], // alpine or subalpine
};
```
This makes a number of improvements:

- name has been replaced with more specific terms: commonName, genus, and
    species.
- endangered has become status, a ConservationStatus type that uses a standard
    classification system from the IUCN.
- habitat has become climates and uses another standard taxonomy, the Köppen
    climate classification.

If you needed more information about the fields in the first version of this type, you’d

have to go find the person who wrote them and ask. In all likelihood, they’ve left the

company or don’t remember. Worse yet, you might run git blame to find out who

wrote these lousy types, only to find that it was you!

**178 | Chapter 4: Type Design**


The situation is much improved with the second version. If you want to learn more

about the Köppen climate classification system or track down what the precise mean‐

ing of a conservation status is, then there are a myriad of resources online to help

you.

Every domain has specialized vocabulary to describe its subject. Rather than invent‐

ing your own terms, try to reuse terms from the domain of your problem. These

vocabularies have often been honed over years, decades, or centuries and are well

understood by people in the field. Using these terms will help you communicate with

users and increase the clarity of your types.

Take care to use domain vocabulary accurately: co-opting the language of a domain

to mean something different is even more confusing than inventing your own.

These same considerations apply to other labels as well, such as function parameter

names, tuple labels, and index type labels.

Here are a few other rules to keep in mind as you name types, properties, and

variables:

- Make distinctions meaningful. In writing and speech it can be tedious to use the
    same word over and over. We introduce synonyms to break the monotony. This
    makes prose more enjoyable to read, but it has the opposite effect on code. If you
    use two different terms, make sure you’re drawing a meaningful distinction. If
    not, you should use the same term.
- Avoid vague, meaningless names like “data,” “info,” “thing,” “item,” “object,” or the
    ever-popular “entity.” If Entity has a specific meaning in your domain, fine. But if
    you’re using it because you don’t want to think of a more meaningful name, then
    you’ll eventually run into trouble: there may be multiple distinct types called
    “Entity” in your project, and can you remember what’s an Item and what’s an
    Entity?
- Name things for what they are, not for what they contain or how they are compu‐
    ted. Directory is more meaningful than INodeList. It allows you to think about
    a directory as a concept, rather than in terms of its implementation. Good names
    can increase your level of abstraction and decrease your risk of inadvertent
    collisions.

**Things to Remember**

- Reuse names from the domain of your problem where possible to increase the
    readability and level of abstraction of your code. Make sure you use domain
    terms accurately.

```
Item 41: Name Types Using the Language of Your Problem Domain | 179
```

- Avoid using different names for the same thing: make distinctions in names
    meaningful.
- Avoid vague names like “Info” or “Entity.” Name types for what they are, rather
    than for their shape.

### Item 42: Avoid Types Based on Anecdotal Data

The other items in this chapter have discussed the many benefits of good type design

and shown what can go wrong without it. A well-designed type makes TypeScript a

pleasure to use, while a poorly designed one can make it miserable to use. But this

does put quite a bit of pressure on type design. Wouldn’t it be nice if you didn’t have

to do this yourself?

At least some of your types are likely to come from outside your program: specifica‐

tions, file formats, APIs, or database schemas. It’s tempting to write declarations for

these types yourself based on the data you’ve seen, perhaps the rows in your test data‐

base or the responses you’ve seen from a particular API endpoint.

Resist this urge! It’s far better to import types from another source or generate them

from a specification. When you write types yourself based on anecdotal data, you’re

only considering the examples you’ve seen. You might be missing important edge

cases that could break your program. When you use more official types, TypeScript

will help ensure that this doesn’t happen.

In Item 30 we used a function that calculated the bounding box of a GeoJSON fea‐

ture. Here’s what a definition might look like:

```
function calculateBoundingBox(f: GeoJSONFeature): BoundingBox | null {
let box: BoundingBox | null = null ;
```
```
const helper = (coords: any []) => {
// ...
};
```
```
const {geometry} = f;
if (geometry) {
helper(geometry.coordinates);
}
```
```
return box;
}
```
How would you define the GeoJSONFeature type? You could look at some GeoJSON

features in your repo and sketch out an interface:

```
interface GeoJSONFeature {
type : 'Feature';
geometry: GeoJSONGeometry | null ;
```
**180 | Chapter 4: Type Design**


```
1 GeoJSON is also known as RFC 7946. The very readable spec is at http://geojson.org.
2 The unusually large major version number matches the RFC number. This was cute at the time but has pro‐
ven a nuisance in practice.
```
```
properties: unknown ;
}
interface GeoJSONGeometry {
type : 'Point' | 'LineString' | 'Polygon' | 'MultiPolygon';
coordinates: number [] | number [][] | number [][][] | number [][][][];
}
```
The function passes the type checker with this definition. But is it really correct? This

check is only as good as our homegrown type declarations.

A better approach would be to use the formal GeoJSON spec.^1 Fortunately for us,

there are already TypeScript type declarations for it on DefinitelyTyped. You can add

these in the usual way:^2

```
$ npm install --save-dev @types/geojson
+ @types/geojson@7946.0.14
```
With these declarations, TypeScript flags an error:

```
import {Feature} from 'geojson';
```
```
function calculateBoundingBox(f: Feature): BoundingBox | null {
let box: BoundingBox | null = null ;
```
```
const helper = (coords: any []) => {
// ...
};
```
```
const {geometry} = f;
if (geometry) {
helper(geometry.coordinates);
// ~~~~~~~~~~~
// Property 'coordinates' does not exist on type 'Geometry'
// Property 'coordinates' does not exist on type 'GeometryCollection'
}
```
```
return box;
}
```
The problem is that this code assumes that a geometry will have a coordinates prop‐

erty. This is true for many geometries, including points, lines, and polygons. But a

GeoJSON geometry can also be a GeometryCollection, a heterogeneous collection of

other geometries. Unlike the other geometry types, it does not have a coordinates

property.

```
Item 42: Avoid Types Based on Anecdotal Data | 181
```

If you call calculateBoundingBox on a feature whose geometry is a Geometry

Collection, it will throw an error about not being able to read property 0 of

undefined. This is a real bug! And we caught it by sourcing types from the

community.

One option for fixing the bug is to explicitly disallow GeometryCollections:

```
const {geometry} = f;
if (geometry) {
if (geometry. type === 'GeometryCollection') {
throw new Error('GeometryCollections are not supported.');
}
helper(geometry.coordinates); // OK
}
```
TypeScript is able to refine the type of geometry based on the check, so the reference

to geometry.coordinates is allowed. If nothing else, this results in a clearer error

message for the user.

But the better solution is to support GeometryCollections! You can do this by pull‐

ing out another helper function:

```
const geometryHelper = (g: Geometry) => {
if (g. type === 'GeometryCollection') {
g.geometries.forEach(geometryHelper);
} else {
helper(g.coordinates); // OK
}
}
```
```
const {geometry} = f;
if (geometry) {
geometryHelper(geometry);
}
```
Our handwritten GeoJSON types were based only on our own experience with the

format, which did not include GeometryCollections. This led to a false sense of secu‐

rity about our code’s correctness. Using community types based on a spec gives you

confidence that your code will work with all values, not just the ones you happen to

have seen.

Similar considerations apply to API calls. If there’s an official TypeScript client for the

API you’re working with, use that! But even if not, you may be able to generate Type‐

Script types from an official source.

If you’re using a GraphQL API, for example, it includes a schema that describes all its

queries and mutations, as well as all the types. There are many tools available to add

TypeScript types to GraphQL queries. Head to your favorite search engine and you’ll

quickly be on the path to type safety.

**182 | Chapter 4: Type Design**


Many REST APIs publish an OpenAPI schema. This is a file that describes all the

endpoints, HTTP verbs (GET, POST, etc.), and types using JSON Schema.

Say we’re using an API that lets us post comments on a blog. Here’s what an OpenAPI

schema might look like:

```
// schema.json
{
"openapi" : "3.0.3",
"info" : { "version" : "1.0.0", "title" : "Sample API" },
"paths" : {
"/comment" : {
"post" : {
"requestBody" : { "content" : { "application/json" : {
"schema" : { "$ref" : "#/components/schemas/Comment" }
}}}
},
"responses" : {
"200" : { /* ... */ }
}
}
},
"components" : {
"schemas" : {
"CreateCommentRequest" : {
"properties" : {
"body" : { "type" : "string" },
"postId" : { "type" : "string" },
"title" : { "type" : "string" }
},
"type" : "object",
"required" : ["postId", "title", "body"]
}
}
}
}
```
The paths section defines the endpoints and associates them with types, which are

found in the components/schemas section. All the information we need to generate

types is here. There are many ways to get types out of an OpenAPI Schema. One is to

extract the schemas and run them through json-schema-to-typescript:

```
$ jq .components.schemas.CreateCommentRequest schema.json > comment.json
$ npx json-schema-to-typescript comment.json > comment.ts
$ cat comment.ts
// ....
export interface CreateCommentRequest {
body: string;
postId: string;
title: string;
}
```
```
Item 42: Avoid Types Based on Anecdotal Data | 183
```

This results in nice, clean interfaces that will help you interact with this API in a

type-safe way. TypeScript will flag type errors in your request bodies and the response

types will flow through your code. The important thing is that you didn’t write the

types yourself. Rather, they’re generated from a reliable source of truth. If a field is

optional or can be null, TypeScript will know about it and force you to handle that

possibility.

A next step here would be to add runtime validation and connect the types directly to

the endpoints with which they’re associated. There are many tools that can help you

with this, and Item 74 will return to this example.

When you generate types, you do need to ensure that they stay in sync with the API

schema. Item 58 discusses strategies for handling this.

What if there’s no spec or official schema available? Then you’ll have to generate types

from data. Tools like quicktype can help with this. But be aware that your types may

not match reality: there may be edge cases that you’ve missed. (An exception would

be if your data set is finite, for example, a directory of 1,000 JSON files. Then you

know that you haven’t missed anything!)

Even if you’re not aware of it, you are already benefiting from code generation. Type‐

Script’s type declarations for the browser DOM API, which are explored in Item 75,

are generated from the API descriptions on MDN. This ensures that they correctly

model a complicated system and helps TypeScript catch errors and misunderstand‐

ings in your own code.

**Things to Remember**

- Avoid writing types by hand based on data that you’ve seen. It’s easy to misunder‐
    stand a schema or get nullability wrong.
- Prefer types sourced from official clients or the community. If these don’t exist,
    generate TypeScript types from schemas.

**184 | Chapter 4: Type Design**


**CHAPTER 5**

### Unsoundness and the any Type

Type systems were traditionally binary affairs: either a language had a fully static type

system or a fully dynamic one. TypeScript blurs the line, because its type system is

optional and gradual. You’re free to add types to parts of your program but not others.

This is essential for migrating existing JavaScript codebases to TypeScript bit by bit

(Chapter 10). Key to this is the any type, which effectively disables type checking for

parts of your code. It is both powerful and prone to abuse. Learning to use any wisely

is essential for writing effective TypeScript. This chapter walks you through how to

limit the downsides of any while still retaining its benefits.

The any type is just the most extreme example of the more general problem of

unsoundness: when a symbol’s static type does not match its runtime type. Even if you

eliminate all the anys from your code, you may still fall into soundness traps. Item 48

presents a few of these and shows you how to avoid them.

### Item 43: Use the Narrowest Possible Scope for any Types

Consider this code:

```
declare function getPizza(): Pizza;
function eatSalad(salad: Salad) { /* ... */ }
```
```
function eatDinner() {
const pizza = getPizza();
eatSalad(pizza);
// ~~~~~
// Argument of type 'Pizza' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Salad'
pizza.slice();
}
```
##### 185


If you somehow know that this call to eatSalad is OK, the best way forward is to

adjust your types so that TypeScript understands that, too. (An arugula pizza with

parmesan and lemon is kind of like a salad!) But if, for whatever reason, you can’t do

that, you can use any to force TypeScript to accept this code in two ways:

```
function eatDinner1() {
const pizza: any = getPizza(); // Don't do this
eatSalad(pizza); // ok
pizza.slice(); // This call is unchecked!
}
```
```
function eatDinner2() {
const pizza = getPizza();
eatSalad(pizza as any ); // This is preferable
pizza.slice(); // this is safe
}
```
Of these, the second form is vastly preferable. Why? Because the any type is scoped to

a single expression in a function argument. It has no effect outside this argument or

this line. When code after the eatSalad call references pizza, its type is still Pizza,

and it can still trigger type errors; whereas in the first example, its type is any for its

entire lifetime until it goes out of scope at the end of the function. This means that

the pizza.slice() call is completely unchecked. A spelling mistake or incorrect

parameter type will pass the type checker but throw an exception when you run it.

It would also have been bad to make eatSalad accept an any type. While this would

have left pizza with a Pizza type in eatDinner, it would have prevented type check‐

ing on this parameter for all calls to eatSalad in your program, not just this one.

The stakes become significantly higher if you return pizza from eatDinner. Look

what happens:

```
function eatDinner1() {
const pizza: any = getPizza();
eatSalad(pizza);
pizza.slice();
return pizza; // unsafe pizza!
}
```
```
function spiceItUp() {
const pizza = eatDinner1();
// ^? const pizza: any
pizza.addRedPepperFlakes(); // This call is also unchecked!
}
```
An any return type is “contagious” in that it can spread throughout a codebase. As a

result of our changes to eatDinner1, an any type has quietly appeared in spiceItUp.

This would not have happened with the more narrowly scoped any in eatDinner2.

**186 | Chapter 5: Unsoundness and the any Type**


This is a good reason to consider including explicit return type annotations, even

when the return type can be inferred. It prevents an any type from inadvertently

“escaping.” You’d have to explicitly write any. See Item 18 for more on the pros and

cons of annotating return types. There are a few functions in the standard library that

return an any type, notably JSON.parse. These are quite dangerous! Item 71 explores

ways to protect yourself.

We used any here to suppress an error that we believed to be incorrect. Another way

to do this is with @ts-ignore or @ts-expect-error:

```
function eatDinner1() {
const pizza = getPizza();
// @ts-ignore
eatSalad(pizza);
pizza.slice();
}
```
```
function eatDinner2() {
const pizza = getPizza();
// @ts-expect-error
eatSalad(pizza);
pizza.slice();
}
```
These silence an error on the next line, leaving the type of pizza unchanged. Of these

two forms, @ts-expect-error is preferable because if the error goes away later (per‐

haps the signature of eatSalad changed), TypeScript will tell you, and you’ll be able

to remove the directive.

Because they’re explicitly scoped to one line, @ts-ignore and @ts-expect-error

aren’t “contagious” in the way that any can be. Still, try not to lean too heavily on

these directives: the type checker usually has a good reason to complain and, if the

error on the next line changes to something more problematic, you’ll have prevented

TypeScript from letting you know. And if a second error appears on the same line,

you’ll never find out about it.

You may also run into situations where you get a type error for just one property in a

larger object:

```
const config: Config = {
a: 1,
b: 2,
c: {
key: value
// ~~~ Property ... missing in type 'Bar' but required in type 'Foo'
}
};
```
```
Item 43: Use the Narrowest Possible Scope for any Types | 187
```

You can silence errors like this by throwing an as any around the whole config

object:

```
const config: Config = {
a: 1,
b: 2,
c: {
key: value
}
} as any ; // Don't do this!
```
But this has the side effect of disabling type checking for the other properties (a and

b) as well. Using a more narrowly scoped any limits the damage:

```
const config: Config = {
a: 1,
b: 2, // These properties are still checked
c: {
key: value as any
}
};
```
If the first example involved limiting the scope of any in time, this is limiting the

scope in space. In both cases the goal is the same: if you must use any, reduce its

scope as much as you possibly can to avoid collateral damage.

If you adopt typescript-eslint’s recommended-type-checked preset, you’ll enable a set

of rules such as no-unsafe-assignment and no-unsafe-return that help to highlight

the spread of any types.

**Things to Remember**

- Make your uses of any as narrowly scoped as possible to avoid undesired loss of
    type safety elsewhere in your code.
- Never return an any type from a function. This will silently lead to the loss of
    type safety for code that calls the function.
- Use as any on individual properties of a larger object instead of the whole object.

### Item 44: Prefer More Precise Variants of any to Plain any

The any type encompasses all values that can be expressed in JavaScript. This is a vast

domain! It includes not just all numbers and strings, but all arrays, objects, regular

expressions, functions, classes, and DOM elements, not to mention null and

undefined. When you use an any type, ask whether you really had something more

specific in mind. Would it be OK to pass in a regular expression or a function?

**188 | Chapter 5: Unsoundness and the any Type**


Often the answer is “no,” in which case you might be able to retain some type safety

by using a more specific type:

```
function getLengthBad(array: any ) { // Don't do this!
return array.length;
}
```
```
function getLength(array: any []) { // This is better
return array.length;
}
```
The latter version, which uses any[] instead of any, is better in three ways:

- The reference to array.length in the function body is type checked.
- The function’s return type is inferred as number instead of any.
- Calls to getLength will be checked to ensure that the parameter is an array:

```
getLengthBad(/123/); // No error, returns undefined
getLength(/123/);
// ~~~~~
// Argument of type 'RegExp' is not assignable to parameter of type 'any[]'.
```
```
getLengthBad( null ); // No error, throws at runtime
getLength( null );
// ~~~~
// Argument of type 'null' is not assignable to parameter of type 'any[]'.
```
If you expect a parameter to be an array of arrays but don’t care about the type, you

can use any[][].

If you expect some sort of object but don’t know what the values will be, you can use

{[key: string]: any} or Record<string, any>:

```
function hasAKeyThatEndsWithZ(o: Record< string , any >) {
for ( const key in o) {
if (key.endsWith('z')) {
console.log(key, o[key]);
return true ;
}
}
return false ;
}
```
You could also use the object type in this situation, which includes all nonprimitive

types. This is slightly different in that, while you can still enumerate keys, you can’t

access the values of any of them:

```
function hasAKeyThatEndsWithZ(o: object) {
for ( const key in o) {
if (key.endsWith('z')) {
console.log(key, o[key]);
```
```
Item 44: Prefer More Precise Variants of any to Plain any | 189
```

```
// ~~~~~~ Element implicitly has an 'any' type
// because type '{}' has no index signature
return true ;
}
}
return false ;
}
```
Iterating over object types is particularly tricky in TypeScript. Item 60 goes into much

more detail about how to work around this particular issue.

Avoid using any if you expect a function type. You have several options here depend‐

ing on how specific you want to get:

```
type Fn0 = () => any ; // any function callable with no params
type Fn1 = (arg: any ) => any ; // With one param
type FnN = (...args: any []) => any ; // With any number of params
// same as "Function" type
```
All of these are more precise than any and hence preferable to it. Note the use of

any[] as the type for the rest parameter in the last example. any would also work here

but would be less precise:

```
const numArgsBad = (...args: any ) => args.length;
// ^? const numArgsBad: (...args: any) => any
const numArgsBetter = (...args: any []) => args.length;
// ^? const numArgsBetter: (...args: any[]) => number
```
Note the differing return types. Rest parameters are perhaps the most common use of

the any[] type.

If you want an array but don’t care about the type of the elements, you may be able to

use unknown[] instead of any[]. This is preferable because it is safer. See Item 46 for

more on the unknown type.

**Things to Remember**

- When you use any, think about whether any JavaScript value is truly permissible.
- Prefer more precise forms of any such as any[] or {[id: string]: any} or
    () => any if they more accurately model your data.

### Item 45: Hide Unsafe Type Assertions in Well-Typed Functions

In an ideal world, your functions have exactly the type signatures you want and their

implementations (also in TypeScript) pass the type checker, contain no type

assertions or any types, and don’t fall into any other soundness traps (Item 48).

Fortunately, this is the case for most functions you’ll write. But this is the chapter on

**190 | Chapter 5: Unsoundness and the any Type**


any and unsoundness, so you won’t be surprised to hear that things aren’t always

ideal.

If you have to choose between a safe, assertion-free function implementation and the

type signature that you want, choose the type signature. It’s the public API of your

function, and it’s visible to the rest of your code and your users. The function’s imple‐

mentation is a detail that’s hidden from your users. Your assertions and any types will

be hidden from view there. Much better to have an unsafe (but well-tested) imple‐

mentation than to adopt a type signature that makes life hard for your users.

To see how this might come up, consider this code that fetches information about

mountain peaks:

```
interface MountainPeak {
name: string ;
continent: string ;
elevationMeters: number ;
firstAscentYear: number ;
}
```
```
async function checkedFetchJSON(url: string ): Promise< unknown > {
const response = await fetch(url);
if (!response.ok) {
throw new Error(`Unable to fetch! ${response.statusText}`);
}
return response.json();
}
```
```
export async function fetchPeak(peakId: string ): Promise<MountainPeak> {
return checkedFetchJSON(`/api/mountain-peaks/${peakId}`);
// ~~~~~ Type 'unknown' is not assignable to type 'MountainPeak'.
}
```
The checkedFetchJSON wrapper provides two services here. First, it checks whether

the fetch succeeded and throws (thus rejecting the Promise) if it did not. Second, it

gives the JSON response an unknown type (Item 46) which is safer than the any type

that you’d get by default.

Unfortunately, there’s a type error because unknown is not assignable to MountainPeak.

If you want to avoid type assertions or any types in your fetchPeak implementation,

you’ll have to change the return type to match:

```
export async function fetchPeak(peakId: string ): Promise< unknown > {
return checkedFetchJSON(`/api/mountain-peaks/${peakId}`); // ok
}
```
```
Item 45: Hide Unsafe Type Assertions in Well-Typed Functions | 191
```

This passes the type checker and contains no unsafe assertions (good!), but this

comes at a significant cost. The fetchPeak function is now extremely hard to use:

```
const sevenPeaks = [
'aconcagua', 'denali', 'elbrus', 'everest', 'kilimanjaro', 'vinson', 'wilhelm'
];
async function getPeaksByHeight(): Promise<MountainPeak[]> {
const peaks = await Promise.all(sevenPeaks.map(fetchPeak));
return peaks.toSorted(
// ~~~ Type 'unknown' is not assignable to type 'MountainPeak'.
(a, b) => b.elevationMeters - a.elevationMeters
// ~ ~ 'b' and 'a' are of type 'unknown'
);
}
```
Any code that calls it will likely have to use a type assertion:

```
async function getPeaksByDate(): Promise<MountainPeak[]> {
const peaks = await Promise.all(sevenPeaks.map(fetchPeak)) as MountainPeak[];
return peaks.toSorted((a, b) => b.firstAscentYear - a.firstAscentYear);
}
```
This will result in type assertions scattered throughout your code whenever you call

fetchPeak. This is duplicative, tedious, and introduces the possibility that you’ll

assert different types in different places.

Rather than changing the return type of fetchPeak to placate the type checker, a bet‐

ter approach would be to keep the type signature as it was and add an assertion in the

function body:

```
export async function fetchPeak(peakId: string ): Promise<MountainPeak> {
return checkedFetchJSON(
`/api/mountain-peaks/${peakId}`,
) as Promise<MountainPeak>;
}
```
With the type assertion hidden away in the function implementation, calling code can

be written cleanly without any knowledge of our unsafe secret:

```
async function getPeaksByContinent(): Promise<MountainPeak[]> {
const peaks = await Promise.all(sevenPeaks.map(fetchPeak)); // no assertion!
return peaks.toSorted((a, b) => a.continent.localeCompare(b.continent));
}
```
By localizing the type assertion, we’ve also made it easier to increase its safety. Here’s a

version that checks at least some of the shape of the response:

```
export async function fetchPeak(peakId: string ): Promise<MountainPeak> {
const maybePeak = checkedFetchJSON(`/api/mountain-peaks/${peakId}`);
if (
!maybePeak ||
typeof maybePeak !== 'object' ||
!('firstAscentYear' in maybePeak)
```
**192 | Chapter 5: Unsoundness and the any Type**


##### ) {

```
throw new Error(`Invalid mountain peak: ${JSON.stringify(maybePeak)}`);
}
return checkedFetchJSON(
`/api/mountain-peaks/${peakId}`,
) as Promise<MountainPeak>;
}
```
You’re unlikely to do this sort of shape checking at every single call site, but it’s easy

enough to do with the type assertion in one place. (If you find yourself writing this

sort of validation code often, Item 74 introduces some more systematic approaches

for validating TypeScript types at runtime. All these approaches hide type assertions

in well-typed functions!)

Another way to hide a type assertion is by providing a single overload of the function:

```
export async function fetchPeak(peakId: string ): Promise<MountainPeak>;
export async function fetchPeak(peakId: string ): Promise< unknown > {
return checkedFetchJSON(`/api/mountain-peaks/${peakId}`); // OK
}
```
```
const denali = fetchPeak('denali');
// ^? const denali: Promise<MountainPeak>
```
In this case, the overload presents a different type signature to callers of the function

than the one used in the implementation. There is some safety here: TypeScript will

check that the two signatures are compatible. But this isn’t fundamentally any differ‐

ent than a type assertion, and you’d still be well served to do some kind of data

validation.

You might also find yourself pushed into using a type assertion because TypeScript’s

type checker can’t follow along with your code. For example, this function checks if

two objects are shallowly equal to each other:

```
function shallowObjectEqual(a: object, b: object): boolean {
for ( const [k, aVal] of Object.entries(a)) {
if (!(k in b) || aVal !== b[k]) {
// ~~~~ Element implicitly has an 'any' type
// because type '{}' has no index signature
return false ;
}
}
return Object.keys(a).length === Object.keys(b).length;
}
```
It’s a bit surprising that TypeScript complains about the b[k] access despite your hav‐

ing just checked that k in b is true. But it does, so you’ll need to resort to either @ts-

expect-error or an any type.

```
Item 45: Hide Unsafe Type Assertions in Well-Typed Functions | 193
```

This would be the wrong way to fix the type error:

```
function shallowObjectEqualBad(a: object, b: any ): boolean {
for ( const [k, aVal] of Object.entries(a)) {
if (!(k in b) || aVal !== b[k]) { // ok
return false ;
}
}
return Object.keys(a).length === Object.keys(b).length;
}
```
By changing b’s type to any, we allow code that will crash at runtime:

```
shallowObjectEqual({x: 1}, null )
// ~~~~ Type 'null' is not assignable to type 'object'.
shallowObjectEqualBad({x: 1}, null ); // ok, throws at runtime
```
Better to hide the any type inside the function implementation:

```
function shallowObjectEqualGood(a: object, b: object): boolean {
for ( const [k, aVal] of Object.entries(a)) {
if (!(k in b) || aVal !== (b as any )[k]) {
// `(b as any)[k]` is OK because we've just checked `k in b`
return false ;
}
}
return Object.keys(a).length === Object.keys(b).length;
}
```
This any is narrowly scoped (Item 43), does not affect the type signature of the func‐

tion, and even includes a comment explaining why it’s valid. This is a fine use of an

any type and a type assertion. Your code is correct, the type signature is clear, and

your users will be none the wiser.

You should unit test all your code, of course, but this is especially true when it uses

type assertions. Since you’ve told TypeScript to trust you, everything’s OK, and the

burden of proof is on you to show that. Comments explaining why a type assertion is

valid are helpful, but thorough tests are an even better demonstration of correctness.

**Things to Remember**

- Sometimes unsafe type assertions and any types are necessary or expedient.
    When you need to use one, hide it inside a function with a correct signature.
- Don’t compromise a function’s type signature to fix type errors in the implemen‐
    tation.
- Make sure you explain why your type assertions are valid, and unit test your code
    thoroughly.

**194 | Chapter 5: Unsoundness and the any Type**


### Item 46: Use unknown Instead of any for Values with an Unknown Type

Suppose you want to write a YAML parser (YAML can represent the same set of val‐

ues as JSON but allows a superset of JSON’s syntax). What should the return type of

your parseYAML method be? It’s tempting to make it any (like JSON.parse):

```
function parseYAML(yaml: string ): any {
// ...
}
```
But this flies in the face of Item 43’s advice to avoid “contagious” any types, specifi‐

cally by not returning them from functions. (Item 71 will explore how to “fix”

JSON.parse so that it doesn’t return any.)

Ideally, you’d like your users to immediately assign the result to another type:

```
interface Book {
name: string ;
author: string ;
}
const book: Book = parseYAML(`
name: Wuthering Heights
author: Emily Brontë
`);
```
Without the type annotation, though, the book variable would quietly get an any type,

thwarting type checking wherever it’s used:

```
const book = parseYAML(`
name: Jane Eyre
author: Charlotte Brontë
`);
console.log(book.title); // No error, logs "undefined" at runtime
book('read'); // No error, throws "book is not a function" at runtime
```
A safer alternative would be to have parseYAML return an unknown type:

```
function safeParseYAML(yaml: string ): unknown {
return parseYAML(yaml);
}
const book = safeParseYAML(`
name: The Tenant of Wildfell Hall
author: Anne Brontë
`);
console.log(book.title);
// ~~~~ 'book' is of type 'unknown'
book("read");
// Error: 'book' is of type 'unknown'
```
```
Item 46: Use unknown Instead of any for Values with an Unknown Type | 195
```

```
1 With the exception of never.
```
To understand the unknown type, it helps to think about any in terms of assignability.

The power and danger of any come from two properties:

- All types are assignable to the any type.
- The any type is assignable to all other types.^1

If we “think of types as sets of values” (Item 7), the first property means that any is a

supertype of all other types, while the second means that it is a subtype. This is

strange! It means that any doesn’t fit into the type system, since a set can’t simultane‐

ously be both a subset and a superset of all other sets. This is the source of any’s

power but also the reason it’s problematic. Since the type checker is set based, the use

of any effectively disables it.

The unknown type is an alternative to any that does fit into the type system. It has the

first property (any type is assignable to unknown) but not the second (unknown is only

assignable to unknown and, of course, any). It’s known as a “top” type since it’s at the

top of the type hierarchy. The never type is the opposite: it has the second property

(can be assigned to any other type) but not the first (no other type can be assigned to

never). It’s known as a “bottom” type.

Attempting to access a property on a value with the unknown type is an error. So is

attempting to call it or do arithmetic with it. You can’t do much of anything with

unknown, which is exactly the point. The errors about an unknown type will encourage

you to pick something more specific:

```
const book = safeParseYAML(`
name: Villette
author: Charlotte Brontë
`) as Book;
console.log(book.title);
// ~~~~~ Property 'title' does not exist on type 'Book'
book('read');
// Error: This expression is not callable
```
These errors are more sensible. Since unknown is not assignable to other types, you’ll

need a type assertion. But it is also appropriate: we really do know more about the

type of the resulting object than TypeScript does.

unknown is appropriate whenever you know that there will be a value but you either

don’t know or don’t care about its type. The result of parseYAML is one example, but

there are others. In the GeoJSON spec, for example, the properties property of a fea‐

ture is a grab bag of anything JSON serializable. So unknown makes sense:

**196 | Chapter 5: Unsoundness and the any Type**


```
interface Feature {
id?: string | number ;
geometry: Geometry;
properties: unknown ;
}
```
If you write a function to check if an array has fewer than 10 elements, you don’t par‐

ticularly care about the type of the elements. So unknown makes sense here, too:

```
function isSmallArray(arr: readonly unknown []): boolean {
return arr.length < 10;
}
```
As you’ve seen, you can get a more specific type from unknown using a type assertion.

But this isn’t the only way. An instanceof check will do:

```
function processValue(value: unknown ) {
if (value instanceof Date) {
value
// ^? (parameter) value: Date
}
}
```
You can also use a user-defined type guard:

```
function isBook(value: unknown ): value is Book {
return (
typeof (value) === 'object' && value !== null &&
'name' in value && 'author' in value
);
}
function processValue(value: unknown ) {
if (isBook(value)) {
value;
// ^? (parameter) value: Book
}
}
```
TypeScript requires quite a bit of proof to narrow an unknown type: in order to avoid

errors on the in checks, you first have to demonstrate that val is an object type and

that it is non-null (since typeof null === 'object'). As with any user-defined type

guard, remember that it’s no safer than a type assertion. Nothing checks that you’ve

implemented the guard correctly or kept it in sync with your type. (Item 74 discusses

solutions to this conundrum.)

You’ll sometimes see a type parameter used instead of unknown. You could have

declared the safeParseYAML function this way:

```
function safeParseYAML<T>(yaml: string ): T {
return parseYAML(yaml);
}
```
```
Item 46: Use unknown Instead of any for Values with an Unknown Type | 197
```

This is generally considered bad style in TypeScript, however. It looks different than a

type assertion, but it is no safer and is functionally the same. Better to just return

unknown and force your users to use an assertion, or narrow to the type they want.

This is a common example of an unnecessary use of generics, which is the subject of

Item 51.

unknown can also be used instead of any in “double assertions”:

```
declare const foo: Foo;
let barAny = foo as any as Bar;
let barUnk = foo as unknown as Bar;
```
These are functionally equivalent, but the unknown version prevents the visceral reac‐

tion you and your coworkers might have at seeing as any.

As a final note, you may see code that uses object or {} in a similar way to how

unknown has been described in this item. They are also broad types but are slightly

narrower than unknown:

- The {} type consists of all values except null and undefined.
- The Object type (capital “O”) is the nearly the same as {}. Strings, numbers, boo‐
    leans, and other primitives are assignable to Object.
- The object type (lowercase “o”) consists of all nonprimitive types. This doesn’t
    include true or 12 or "foo", but does include objects, arrays, and functions.

It’s quite rare that you really want to permit any value except null and undefined, so

unknown is generally preferable to {} or Object.

**Things to Remember**

- The unknown type is a type-safe alternative to any. Use it when you know you
    have a value but do not know or do not care what its type is.
- Use unknown to force your users to use a type assertion or other form of
    narrowing.
- Avoid return-only type parameters, which can create a false sense of security.
- Understand the difference between {}, object, and unknown.

### Item 47: Prefer Type-Safe Approaches to Monkey Patching

One of the most famous features of JavaScript is that its objects and classes are “open”

in the sense that you can add arbitrary properties to them. This is occasionally used

to create global variables on web pages by assigning to window or document:

**198 | Chapter 5: Unsoundness and the any Type**


```
window.monkey = 'Tamarin';
document.monkey = 'Howler';
```
or to attach data to DOM elements:

```
const el = document.getElementById('colobus');
el.home = 'tree';
```
Adding properties to built-in objects at runtime is known as “monkey patching” and

is particularly common with code that uses jQuery or D3.

You can even attach properties to the prototypes of built-ins, with sometimes surpris‐

ing results:

```
> RegExp.prototype.monkey = 'Capuchin'
'Capuchin'
> /123/.monkey
'Capuchin'
```
These approaches are generally not good designs. When you attach data to window or

a DOM node, you are essentially turning it into a global variable. This makes it easy

to inadvertently introduce dependencies between far-flung parts of your program,

and means that you have to think about side effects whenever you call a function.

Outside of strict mode, JavaScript makes it very easy to introduce global variables:

just drop the let, var, or const from an assignment.

Adding TypeScript introduces another problem: while the type checker knows about

built-in properties of Document and HTMLElement, it certainly doesn’t know about the

ones you’ve added:

```
document.monkey = 'Tamarin';
// ~~~~~~ Property 'monkey' does not exist on type 'Document'
```
The most straightforward way to fix this error is with an any assertion:

```
(document as any ).monkey = 'Tamarin'; // OK
```
This satisfies the type checker, but, as should be no surprise by now, it has some

downsides. As with any use of any, you lose type safety and language services:

```
(document as any ).monky = 'Tamarin'; // Also OK, misspelled
(document as any ).monkey = /Tamarin/; // Also OK, wrong type
```
The best solution is to move your data out of window, document, or the DOM. But if

you can’t (perhaps you’re using a library that requires it or are in the process of

migrating a JavaScript application), then the monkey patch is part of your environ‐

ment (Item 76) and you should model it with TypeScript. There’s no perfect way to do

this, but as any sets a low bar for safety and developer experience, and there are ways

to do considerably better.

```
Item 47: Prefer Type-Safe Approaches to Monkey Patching | 199
```

Imagine you’re building a web application and you have an object with information

about the currently logged-in user. You fetch this on page load via an API and store it

as a global variable for convenient access throughout your code:

```
interface User {
name: string ;
}
```
```
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", async () => {
const response = await fetch('/api/users/current-user');
const user = ( await response.json()) as User;
window.user = user;
// ~~~~ Property 'user' does not exist
// on type 'Window & typeof globalThis'.
});
```
```
// ... elsewhere ...
export function greetUser() {
alert(`Hello ${window.user.name}!`);
// ~~~~ Property 'user' does not exist on type Window...
}
```
The type errors arise because TypeScript doesn’t know about our patch to the global

object. Rather than writing (window as any), one option is to use an augmentation,

one of the special abilities of interface (Item 13):

```
declare global {
interface Window {
/** The currently logged-in user */
user: User;
}
}
```
This tells TypeScript that Window has another property that it didn’t know about from

the built-in DOM types. With the augmentation in place, our code passes the type

checker:

```
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", async () => {
const response = await fetch('/api/users/current-user');
const user = ( await response.json()) as User;
window.user = user; // OK
});
```
```
// ... elsewhere ...
export function greetUser() {
alert(`Hello ${window.user.name}!`); // OK
}
```
**200 | Chapter 5: Unsoundness and the any Type**


This is an improvement over using any in a few ways:

- You get type safety. The type checker will flag misspellings or assignments of the
    wrong type.
- You can attach documentation to the property (Item 68).
- You get autocomplete and other language services on the property.
- There is a record of precisely what the monkey patch is.

There are a few problems with the augmentation approach. In cases (such as user)

where a global is set while your application is running, there’s no way to introduce the

augmentation only after this has happened. This masks a race condition in our code.

What happens if we call greetUser() before window.user is set?

To avoid issues like this, you may want to include undefined as a possibility on your

global. This will force you to handle the possibility that user isn’t available wherever

you access it:

```
declare global {
interface Window {
/** The currently logged-in user */
user: User | undefined ;
}
}
```
##### // ...

```
export function greetUser() {
alert(`Hello ${window.user.name}!`);
// ~~~~~~~~~~~ 'window.user' is possibly 'undefined'.
}
```
There’s a trade-off here between correctness and convenience.

If your serving infrastructure allows it, another solution for this specific situation

would be to inline the user variable into the HTML of the page:

```
< script type="text/javascript">
window.user = { name: 'Bill Withers' };
</ script >
< script src="your-code.js"></ script >
```
This way you can safely remove the undefined possibility since user has been uncon‐

ditionally set before any of your code runs and there’s no possibility of a race

condition.

Another issue with augmentation is that, as the declare global suggests, it applies

globally. You can’t hide it from other parts of your code or from libraries. If your app

includes multiple pages and user is only available on some of them, the global aug‐

mentation won’t be able to model that accurately.

```
Item 47: Prefer Type-Safe Approaches to Monkey Patching | 201
```

An alternative approach that doesn’t pollute the global scope is to use a narrower type

assertion. Rather than (window as any), we can define another type with our added

property:

```
type MyWindow = ( typeof window) & {
/** The currently logged-in user */
user: User | undefined ;
}
```
```
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", async () => {
const response = await fetch('/api/users/current-user');
const user = ( await response.json()) as User;
(window as MyWindow).user = user; // OK
});
```
```
// ...
export function greetUser() {
alert(`Hello ${(window as MyWindow).user.name}!`);
// ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Object is possibly 'undefined'.
}
```
TypeScript is OK with the type assertion because Window and MyWindow share proper‐

ties (Item 9). And you get type safety in the assignment. The scope issues are also

more manageable: there’s no global modification of the Window type, just the intro‐

duction of a new type (which is only in scope if you import it).

The downside is that you have to write an assertion (or introduce a new variable)

whenever you reference the monkey-patched property. And you’ll want to enforce

that no one sneaks in a (window as any), perhaps using a linter rule.

But you can take this all as encouragement to refactor into something more struc‐

tured. Monkey patching shouldn’t be too easy!

**Things to Remember**

- Prefer structured code to storing data in globals or on the DOM.
- If you must store data on built-in types, use one of the type-safe approaches (aug‐
    mentation or asserting a custom interface).
- Understand the scoping issues of augmentations. Include undefined if that’s a
    possibility at runtime.

### Item 48: Avoid Soundness Traps

Hang out on the internet much and you’ll hear gripes about how TypeScript isn’t

“sound,” and that this makes it a poor choice of language. This item will explain what

this means and walk you through common sources of unsoundness in TypeScript.

**202 | Chapter 5: Unsoundness and the any Type**


Rest assured, TypeScript is a great language, and it’s never a good idea to listen to

people on the internet!

A language is called “sound” if the static type of every symbol is guaranteed to be

compatible with its runtime value. Using the terminology from Item 7, this means

that every symbol’s runtime value remains in the domain of that symbol’s static type.

Here’s an example of a sound type:

```
const x = Math.random();
// ^? const x: number
```
TypeScript infers a static type of number for x, and this is sound: whatever value

Math.random() returns at runtime, it will be a number. This doesn’t mean that x could

be any number at runtime: a more precise type would be the half-open interval

[0, 1), but TypeScript has no way to express this. number is good enough. Soundness

is more about accuracy than precision.

Here’s an example of unsoundness in TypeScript:

```
const xs = [0, 1, 2];
// ^? const xs: number[]
const x = xs[3];
// ^? const x: number
```
The static type of x is inferred as number, but at runtime its value is undefined, which

is not a number. So this is unsound and can lead to problems at runtime, for example,

if you try to call a method on x:

```
console.log(x.toFixed(1));
```
There are no type errors, but when you run this code it will throw an error:

```
console.log(x.toFixed(1));
^
```
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toFixed')
```
Unsound types can easily lead to runtime errors, so a sound type system is generally

considered to be a desirable property of a programming language.

Soundness comes with trade-offs, however. It’s easier for less expressive type systems

to achieve soundness. If TypeScript didn’t support generic types, for example, it

would eliminate many of the sources of unsoundness that you’ll read about later. But

generic types are useful! This hypothetical version of TypeScript would have a harder

time modeling JavaScript patterns and would catch fewer bugs.

In other words, there’s a trade-off among a type system’s expressiveness, its sound‐

ness, and its convenience. TypeScript gives you some choices about where you want

to be on this spectrum: by enabling strictNullChecks (Item 2), you accept some

```
Item 48: Avoid Soundness Traps | 203
```

inconvenience (needing to annotate null types and do null checks) in exchange for

increased expressiveness.

As we saw previously, TypeScript as a whole is emphatically not sound. In fact, sound‐

ness is not a design goal of TypeScript at all. Instead, it favors convenience and the

ability to work with existing JavaScript libraries.

Still, unsoundness can lead to crashes, bugs, or even data corruption, and you should

avoid it when you can. Unchecked array accesses are one well-known soundness trap,

but there are many others in TypeScript. The rest of this item will go through some of

the sources of unsoundness in TypeScript and show how you can rework your code

to avoid them.

**any**

If you “put an any on it,” then anything goes. The static types may or may not have

anything to do with real runtime types:

```
function logNumber(x: number ) {
console.log(x.toFixed(1)); // x is a string at runtime
// ^? (parameter) x: number
}
const num: any = 'forty two';
logNumber(num); // no error
```
There are no type errors here, but this code will throw an exception at runtime.

The solution is simple: limit your use of any or, better, don’t use it at all! This chapter

has lots of advice about how to mitigate and avoid the static type disaster that is any,

but the highlights are to limit the scope of any and to use unknown as a safer alterna‐

tive when possible. For built-ins like JSON.parse that return any types, Item 71 shows

you how to use declaration merging to get a safer alternative.

**Type Assertions**

The slightly less offensive cousin of any is the “type assertion.” We’ve already covered

this in Item 9, but here’s a refresher on what this looks like:

```
function logNumber(x: number ) {
console.log(x.toFixed(1));
}
const hour = ( new Date()).getHours() || null ;
// ^? const hour: number | null
logNumber(hour);
// ~~~~ ... Type 'null' is not assignable to type 'number'.
logNumber(hour as number ); // type checks, but might blow up at runtime
```
The as number in the last line is the type assertion, and it makes the error go away.

**204 | Chapter 5: Unsoundness and the any Type**


What can you do about this? You can replace many assertions with conditionals (if

statements or ternary operators):

```
if (hour !== null ) {
logNumber(hour); // ok
// ^? const hour: number
}
```
Within the if block, the static type of hour is narrowed based on the condition, so the

type assertion isn’t needed (see Item 22 for more on narrowing).

Type assertions often come up in the context of input validation. It’s a good idea to

adopt a systematic approach to keeping your TypeScript types and your runtime vali‐

dation logic in sync. Item 74 will walk you through your options.

**Object and Array Lookups**

Even in strict mode, TypeScript doesn’t do any sort of bounds checking on array

lookups. As we saw in the introduction to this item, this can lead directly to unsound‐

ness and runtime errors.

The same can happen when you reference a property on an object with an index type:

```
type IdToName = { [id: string ]: string };
const ids: IdToName = {'007': 'James Bond'};
const agent = ids['008']; // undefined at runtime.
// ^? const agent: string
```
Why does TypeScript allow this sort of code? Because it’s extremely common and

because it’s quite difficult to prove whether any particular index/array access is valid.

If you’d like TypeScript to try, there’s a noUncheckedIndexedAccess option. If you

turn it on, it finds the error in the example from the introduction but also flags per‐

fectly valid code:

```
const xs = [1, 2, 3];
alert(xs[3].toFixed(1)); // invalid code
// ~~~~~ Object is possibly 'undefined'.
alert(xs[2].toFixed(1)); // valid code
// ~~~~~ Object is possibly 'undefined'.
```
This option moves you to a different place on the spectrum of soundness versus con‐

venience: TypeScript is able to catch more errors, but it is less convenient to work

with because it also flags code that’s not an error. noUncheckedIndexedAccess is at

least smart enough to understand some common array constructs:

```
const xs = [1, 2, 3];
for ( const x of xs) {
console.log(x.toFixed(1)); // OK
}
const squares = xs.map(x => x * x); // also OK
```
```
Item 48: Avoid Soundness Traps | 205
```

If you’re concerned about unsafe access to specific arrays or objects, you can explicitly

add undefined to their value types:

```
const xs: ( number | undefined )[] = [1, 2, 3];
alert(xs[3].toFixed(1));
// ~~~~~ Object is possibly 'undefined'.
```
```
type IdToName = { [id: string ]: string | undefined };
const ids: IdToName = {'007': 'James Bond'};
const agent = ids['008'];
// ^? const agent: string | undefined
alert(agent.toUpperCase());
// ~~~~~ 'agent' is possibly 'undefined'.
```
The advantage of this approach over noUncheckedIndexedAccess is that it lets you

limit the scope (and presumably false positives) of that flag. The disadvantage is that

it lacks the smarts of the flag: the for-of loop will give you errors with this approach.

It also introduces the possibility that you push an undefined onto the array.

Finally, it’s often possible to rework your code to reduce the need for these sorts of

lookups. Rather than passing indices or keys to functions, try to work with the objects

that they refer to.

**Inaccurate Type Definitions**

The type declarations for a JavaScript library are like a giant type assertion: they claim

to statically model the runtime behavior of the library but there’s nothing that guar‐

antees this. (Unless, that is, the library is written in TypeScript, the declarations are

generated by tsc, and the library has no unsound types!)

It’s hard to show a current example here since these kinds of bugs tend to get fixed

once you highlight them, particularly for declarations on DefinitelyTyped (@types).

But a famous historic one was the React.FC definition in @types/react, which made

UI components accept children, even when this didn’t make logical sense.

How do you work around this? The best way is to fix the bug! For types on Definite‐

lyTyped, the turnaround time on this is usually a week or less. If this isn’t an option,

you can work around some issues via augmentation or, in the worst case, a type

assertion.

It’s also worth noting that some functions have types that are just very hard to model

statically. Take a look at the parameter list for String.prototype.replace for a head-

scratching example:

```
'foo'.replace(/f(.)/, (fullMatch, group1, offset, fullString, namedGroups) => {
console.log(fullMatch); // "fo"
console.log(group1); // "o"
console.log(offset); // 0
console.log(fullString); // "foo"
```
**206 | Chapter 5: Unsoundness and the any Type**


```
console.log(namedGroups); // undefined
return fullMatch;
});
```
If you’re interested in the offset parameter, its position will depend on the number

of capture groups (parenthesized expressions) in your regular expression. TypeScript

has no concept of a regex literal type, so there’s no way to determine the number of

capture groups statically. So the callback parameters get an any type.

There are also some functions that are incorrectly typed for historical reasons, e.g.,

Object.assign. If this is causing you trouble, Item 71 has a fix.

Type declarations model more than just JavaScript libraries. They also describe the

environment in which your code runs: the expected JavaScript runtime and other

global environments. Item 76 has more to say about the importance of creating an

accurate model of your environment.

**Bivariance in Class Hierarchies**

Assignability is tricky to think about with function types. It works a bit differently for

the return type and the parameter types. For the return type, assignability works

exactly like any other type:

```
declare function f(): number | string ;
const f1: () => number | string | boolean = f; // OK
const f2: () => number = f;
// ~~ Type '() => string | number' is not assignable to type '() => number'.
// Type 'string | number' is not assignable to type 'number'.
```
This makes sense: if you call a function expecting it to return a number but the func‐

tion could also return a string, then trouble will ensue. We say that functions are

covariant in their return types.

Parameter types go the opposite way:

```
declare function f(x: number | string ): void ;
const f1: (x: number | string | boolean ) => void = f;
// ~~
// Type 'string | number | boolean' is not assignable to type 'string | number'.
const f2: (x: number ) => void = f; // OK
```
This also makes sense: you shouldn’t be able to call a function expecting number|

string with a boolean. Functions are contravariant in their parameter types.

Now let’s see what happens when we apply this to classes:

```
class Parent {
foo(x: number | string ) {}
bar(x: number ) {}
}
class Child extends Parent {
```
```
Item 48: Avoid Soundness Traps | 207
```

```
foo(x: number ) {} // OK
bar(x: number | string ) {} // OK
}
```
Recall from Item 7 that extends on a class or interface can be read as “subtype of.”

But in that case, given what we’ve just learned about function assignability, surely one

of the two methods on Child should be an error. Since functions are contravariant in

their parameter types, the Child foo method should not be assignable to the Parent

foo.

You can adapt this form of unsoundness to get an undetected exception:

```
class FooChild extends Parent {
foo(x: number ) {
console.log(x.toFixed());
}
}
const p: Parent = new FooChild();
p.foo('string'); // No type error, crashes at runtime
```
TypeScript models methods on classes as bivariant: if either the parent or the child

method is assignable to the other, then it’s valid. Historically this was how all function

assignments were modeled. But with strictFunctionTypes, which was introduced in

TypeScript 2.6 way back in 2017, standalone function types are treated more

accurately.

In practice this means that when you’re inheriting from a class, you need to take extra

care to get the method signatures correct. Typically, child classes should have the

exact same method signature as their parents. But they can get out of sync over time

if you change the parent’s signature and expect to get a type error for all child imple‐

mentations. Be on the lookout for this! When you change a method signature on a

class in a hierarchy, check the same method on any parent or child classes.

**TypeScript’s Inaccurate Model of Variance for Objects and Arrays**

This one has been widely discussed online. Here’s the standard example of how it

works:

```
function addFoxOrHen(animals: Animal[]) {
animals.push(Math.random() > 0.5? new Fox() : new Hen());
}
```
```
const henhouse: Hen[] = [ new Hen()];
addFoxOrHen(henhouse); // oh no, a fox in the henhouse!
```
The issue is that it’s only safe to assign Hen[] to Animal[] if you don’t modify

the array. In other words, only readonly Hen[] should be assignable to readonly

Animal[]. TypeScript hasn’t always had readonly, though, and in the early days it

**208 | Chapter 5: Unsoundness and the any Type**


chose to allow this sort of code. Perhaps in the future there will be a new strict

option to handle this source of unsoundness.

What can you do about it? It’s best not to mutate function parameters, which you can

enforce with a readonly annotation (Item 14):

```
function addFoxOrHen(animals: readonly Animal[]) {
animals.push(Math.random() > 0.5? new Fox() : new Hen());
// ~~~~ Property 'push' does not exist on type 'readonly Animal[]'.
}
```
You can dodge the issue entirely by rewriting the initial example so that the function

returns an Animal, rather than adding it to an array:

```
function foxOrHen(): Animal {
return Math.random() > 0.5? new Fox() : new Hen();
}
```
```
const henhouse: Hen[] = [ new Hen(), foxOrHen()];
// ~~~~~~~~~~ error, yay! Chickens are safe.
// Type 'Animal' is missing the following properties from type 'Hen': ...
```
You can run into similar issues with any object mutated by a function, not just arrays.

If you create an alias for your object (Item 23) and mutate it, then you can run into

trouble even without a function call.

While variance can be tricky to think about, the lesson here is straightforward: avoid

mutating function parameters! And to make sure you don’t, declare them readonly

or Readonly.

**Function Calls Don’t Invalidate Refinements**

Here’s some code that doesn’t look too suspicious at first glance (at least from a type

safety perspective):

```
interface FunFact {
fact: string ;
author?: string ;
}
```
```
function processFact(fact: FunFact, processor: (fact: FunFact) => void ) {
if (fact.author) {
processor(fact);
console.log(fact.author.blink()); // ok
// ^? (property) FunFact.author?: string
}
}
```
Depending on what processor does, however, the call to blink() might throw at

runtime:

```
Item 48: Avoid Soundness Traps | 209
```

```
processFact(
{fact: 'Peanuts are not actually nuts', author: 'Botanists'},
f => delete f.author
);
// Type checks, but throws `Cannot read property 'blink' of undefined`.
```
The issue is that if (fact.author) refines the type of fact.author from string|

undefined to string. This is sound. However, the call to processor(fact) should

invalidate this refinement. The type of fact.author should revert back to string|

undefined because TypeScript has no way of knowing what the callback will do to

our refined fact.

Why does TypeScript allow this? Because most functions don’t mutate their parame‐

ters, and this sort of pattern is common in JavaScript.

How can you avoid this? Again, don’t mutate your function parameters! You can

enforce that callbacks do this by passing them a Readonly version of the object

(Item 14).

**Assignability and Optional Properties**

It’s important to remember that object types in TypeScript types aren’t “sealed”: they

could have properties other than the ones you’ve declared (Item 4). When combined

with optional properties, this can lead to unsoundness.

Here’s how this might happen:

```
interface Person {
name: string ;
}
interface PossiblyAgedPerson extends Person {
age?: number ;
}
const p1 = { name: "Serena", age: "42 years" };
const p2: Person = p1;
const p3: PossiblyAgedPerson = p2;
console.log(`${p3.name} is ${p3.age?.toFixed(1)} years old.`);
```
The assignment from p1 to p2 circumvents excess property checking (Item 11). p2 has

a static type of Person. This is sound because the type {name: string; age:

string} is assignable to Person. With structural typing, it’s OK to have extra

properties.

The assignment to p3 is where we lose soundness. If you think of types as being

sealed, without having extra properties, then this assignment should be allowed: a

Person wouldn’t have an age property and, since this property is optional on

PossiblyAgedPerson, that would be OK. But types aren’t sealed and, as happened

here, it’s possible that they have additional properties that are incompatible with the

optional property’s type.

**210 | Chapter 5: Unsoundness and the any Type**


If you run into this issue, it may be because you’ve had a name collision between

overly generic property names (e.g., type). Try choosing more specific property

names. Naming the properties ageInYears and ageFormatted in this example would

have prevented this error.

Unsoundness is just one of the problems with optional properties. Item 37 discusses

other reasons why you should think carefully before adding one.

There are a few other sources of unsoundness in TypeScript, but these are some of the

ones that you’re most likely to come across in practice. Remember, unsoundness isn’t

a flaw in the language. It reflects a choice about where TypeScript wants to be posi‐

tioned along the spectrum of convenience, expressiveness, and safety. If you want to

move to a different point along that spectrum, you have some knobs that let you do

so (e.g., strictNullChecks and noUncheckedIndexedAccess). Otherwise, be aware of

the common patterns that lead to unsoundness and try to avoid them.

**Things to Remember**

- “Unsoundness” is when a symbol’s value at runtime diverges from its static type.
    It can lead to crashes and other bad behavior without type errors.
- Be aware of some of the common ways that unsoundness can arise: any types,
    type assertions (as, is), object and array lookups, and inaccurate type
    definitions.
- Avoid mutating function parameters as this can lead to unsoundness. Mark them
    as read-only if you don’t intend to mutate them.
- Make sure child classes match their parent’s method declarations.
- Be aware of how optional properties can lead to unsound types.

### Item 49: Track Your Type Coverage to Prevent Regressions in Type Safety

You’ve enabled noImplicitAny and added type annotations to all the values that had

implicit any types. Are you safe from the problems associated with any types? The

answer is “no”; any types can still enter your program in two main ways:

Through explicit any types

```
Even if you follow the advice of Items 43 and 44 , making your any types both
narrow and specific, they remain any types. In particular, types like any[] and
{[key: string]: any} become plain anys once you index into them, and the
resulting any types can flow through your code.
```
```
Item 49: Track Your Type Coverage to Prevent Regressions in Type Safety | 211
```

From third-party type declarations

```
This is particularly insidious since any types from an @types declaration file
enter silently: even though you have noImplicitAny enabled and you never
wrote the word “any,” you still have any types flowing through your code.
```
Because of the negative effects any types can have on type safety and developer expe‐

rience (Item 5), it’s a good idea to keep track of the number of them in your codebase.

There are many ways to do this, including the type-coverage package on npm:

```
$ npx type-coverage
9985 / 10117 98.69%
```
This means that, of the 10,117 symbols in this project, 9,985 (98.69%) had a type

other than any or an alias to any. If a change inadvertently introduces an any type and

it flows through your code, you’ll see a corresponding drop in this percentage.

In some ways, this percentage is a way of keeping score on how well you’ve followed

the advice of the other items in this chapter. Using narrowly scoped any will reduce

the number of symbols with any types, and so will using more specific forms like

any[]. Tracking this numerically helps you make sure things only get better over

time.

Even collecting type coverage information once can be informative. Running type-

coverage with the --detail flag will print where every any type occurs in your code:

```
$ npx type-coverage --detail
path/to/code.ts:1:10 getColumnInfo
path/to/module.ts:7:1 pt2
...
```
These are worth investigating because they’re likely to turn up sources of anys that

you hadn’t considered. Let’s look at a few examples.

Explicit any types are often the result of choices you made for expediency earlier on.

Perhaps you were getting a type error that you didn’t want to take the time to sort out.

Maybe the type was one that you hadn’t written out yet. Or you might have just been

in a rush.

Type assertions with any can prevent types from flowing where they otherwise would.

Perhaps you’ve built an application that works with tabular data and needed a single-

parameter function that built up some kind of column description:

```
function getColumnInfo(name: string ): any {
return utils.buildColumnInfo(appState.dataSchema, name); // Returns any
}
```
The utils.buildColumnInfo function returned any at some point. As a reminder,

you added a comment and an explicit : any annotation to the function.

**212 | Chapter 5: Unsoundness and the any Type**


However, in the intervening months you’ve also added a type for ColumnInfo, and

utils.buildColumnInfo no longer returns any. The any annotation is now throwing

away valuable type information. Get rid of it!

Third-party any types can come in a few forms, but the most extreme is when you

give an entire module an any type:

```
declare module 'my-module';
```
Now you can import anything from my-module without error. These symbols all have

any types and will lead to more any types if you pass values through them:

```
import {someMethod, someSymbol} from 'my-module'; // OK
```
```
const pt1 = { x: 1, y: 2 };
// ^? const pt1: { x: number; y: number; }
const pt2 = someMethod(pt1, someSymbol); // OK
// ^? const pt2: any
```
Since the usage looks identical to a well-typed module, it’s easy to forget that you

stubbed out the module. Or maybe a coworker did it and you never knew in the first

place. It’s worth revisiting these from time to time. Maybe there are official type dec‐

larations for the module. Or perhaps after reading Chapter 8 you’ve gained enough

understanding of the module to write types yourself and contribute them back to the

community.

Another common source of anys with third-party declarations is when there’s a bug

in the types. Maybe the declarations didn’t follow the advice of Item 30 and declared a

function to return a union type when in fact it returns something much more spe‐

cific. When you first used the function, this didn’t seem worth fixing so you used an

any assertion. But maybe the declarations have been fixed since then. Or maybe it’s

time to fix them yourself!

If you’d like to continually be aware of the any types in your code, you can set up

type-coverage as a TypeScript Language Service plug-in. This is like having X-ray

vision, letting you see all the any types hiding in plain sight in your code (Figure 5-1).

Figure 5-1. Symbols with an _any_ type highlighted in your editor. None of these would

have been _noImplicitAny_ errors.

```
Item 49: Track Your Type Coverage to Prevent Regressions in Type Safety | 213
```

If you add type-coverage to your continuous integration system, you’ll find out

about surprising drops in type safety as soon as they happen.

The considerations that led you to use an any type may no longer apply. Maybe there’s

a type you can plug in now where previously you used any. Maybe an unsafe type

assertion is no longer necessary. Maybe the bug in the type declarations you were

working around has been fixed. Tracking your type coverage highlights these choices

and encourages you to keep revisiting them.

**Things to Remember**

- Even with noImplicitAny set, any types can make their way into your code either
    through explicit anys or third-party type declarations (@types).
- Consider tracking how well-typed your program is using a tool like type-
    coverage. This will encourage you to revisit decisions about using any and
    increase type safety over time.

**214 | Chapter 5: Unsoundness and the any Type**


**CHAPTER 6**

### Generics and Type-Level Programming

TypeScript’s type system is designed to model the runtime behavior of JavaScript

code. Because JavaScript is so dynamic and permissive, this has pushed TypeScript’s

type system to develop increasingly powerful capabilities. As Item 15 explained, this

includes logic for mapping between types.

When you add generic type aliases to the mix, TypeScript’s type system becomes pow‐

erful enough that you can think of it as its own independent programming language.

(TypeScript’s type system is Turing Complete, so this is true in a formal sense.) Rather

than programming with values, as you do in JavaScript, you’re now programming

with types. In other words, type-level programming. This is distinct from metaprog‐

ramming (writing programs that operate on programs), though the two terms are

sometimes conflated.

Learning new languages is fun, and you can find all sorts of wild applications built

using TypeScript’s type system, ranging from games to SQL parsers. This has been

driven in part by the Type Challenges project, which includes hundreds of increas‐

ingly difficult puzzles to solve in the type system. Solving these as you read this chap‐

ter is a great way to cement what you’ve learned.

This chapter also includes a few cautionary notes. Just because TypeScript includes a

programming language for types doesn’t mean it’s a particularly intuitive, ergonomic,

or pleasant language to work with. Just because you can write logic at the type level

doesn’t mean it’s always a good idea. Overuse of generic types can lead to cryptic,

hard-to-maintain code. Josh Goldberg puts it well in Learning TypeScript (O’Reilly):

```
Although generics can give us a lot of flexibility in describing types in code, they can
become rather complex quite quickly. Programmers new to TypeScript often go
through a phase of overusing generics to the point of making code confusing to read
and overly complex to work with. TypeScript best practice is generally to use generics
only when necessary, and to be clear about what they’re used for when they are.
```
##### 215


This chapter will help you decide whether it’s necessary to use generic types and

presents some alternatives. Used well, type-level code can improve other developers’

experiences without their ever needing to know that there’s fancy type-level code

involved.

### Item 50: Think of Generics as Functions Between Types

Item 15 showed how you can use type operations (extends, mapped types, indexing,

keyof) to reduce repetition between related types. In value-land, functions are one of

the key ways to factor out repeated code. In type-land, the equivalent of a function is

a generic type. A generic type takes one or more type parameters and produces a con‐

crete, nongeneric type. Whereas you “call” a function, you “instantiate” a generic type.

The built-in Partial generic type makes all the properties of another type optional.

Here’s how you might define that yourself:

```
type MyPartial<T> = {[K in keyof T]?: T[K]};
```
Here T is the type parameter. You can see that this works exactly the same as the built-

in Partial type:

```
interface Person {
name: string ;
age: number ;
}
```
```
type MyPartPerson = MyPartial<Person>;
// ^? type MyPartPerson = { name?: string; age?: number; }
```
```
type PartPerson = Partial<Person>;
// ^? type PartPerson = { name?: string; age?: number; }
```
By defining this generic type, we’ve encapsulated the type-level operations required to

optionalize all the properties on another type. This is exactly analogous to how a

function might encapsulate the logic of taking one value and producing another. You

don’t need to know the details of how Math.cos is implemented to know that it calcu‐

lates the cosine of a number.

You can write generic types that take multiple type parameters. Here’s how you might

try to define the equivalent of the built-in Pick generic:

```
type MyPick<T, K> = {
[P in K]: T[P]
// ~ Type 'K' is not assignable to type 'string | number | symbol'.
// ~~~~ Type 'P' cannot be used to index type 'T'.
};
```
**216 | Chapter 6: Generics and Type-Level Programming**


Even when you’re programming at the type level, TypeScript applies all the same tools

of static analysis to check for assignability and other errors in your code. Here it’s

found two problems:

- We’re mapping over K, but TypeScript has no reason to believe that it contains
    types that can be used as property keys, namely string, number, or symbol.
- Even if it were a valid property key, TypeScript has no reason to believe that P can
    be used to index into T. T might not be an object type, and it might not have that
    key.

There are many ways to deal with type-level errors, just as there are many ways to

deal with type errors in nongeneric code. Perhaps the simplest is to ignore them. This

works surprisingly well!

```
// @ts-expect-error (don't do this!)
type MyPick<T, K> = { [P in K]: T[P] };
type AgeOnly = MyPick<Person, 'age'>;
// ^? type AgeOnly = { age: number; }
```
You can think of this as the type-level equivalent of TypeScript emitting JavaScript,

even in the presence of type errors (Item 3). Just because it doesn’t like your imple‐

mentation of a generic type doesn’t mean that TypeScript won’t let you use it.

Of course, TypeScript is right to complain. This version of MyPick is quite error

prone:

```
type FirstNameOnly = MyPick<Person, 'firstName'>;
// ^? type FirstNameOnly = { firstName: unknown; }
type Flip = MyPick<'age', Person>;
// ^? type Flip = {}
```
Rather than getting a type error, incorrect uses of MyPick just return the wrong type.

It’s almost like programming in JavaScript!

Another way to make the error go away is to add intersections with the types that

TypeScript is expecting. Here’s what that looks like:

```
type MyPick<T, K> = { [P in K & PropertyKey]: T[P & keyof T] };
```
```
type AgeOnly = MyPick<Person, 'age'>;
// ^? type AgeOnly = { age: number; }
type FirstNameOnly = MyPick<Person, 'firstName'>;
// ^? type FirstNameOnly = { firstName: never; }
```
PropertyKey is a built-in alias for string | number | symbol. You can think of this

sort of intersection as a kind of type-level equivalent of as any. It has made the type

errors in the implementation go away and left the correct uses unchanged. The incor‐

rect uses come out slightly differently, and this is perhaps an improvement: never is

often an indication that something has gone wrong.

```
Item 50: Think of Generics as Functions Between Types | 217
```

```
1 This name makes more sense if you’re coming from the C++ world, where generic types are known as “tem‐
plate types” and developers talk about “template metaprogramming.”
```
But keeping with the analogy, as any is rarely the right choice in value-land, and

these intersections are not typically the best choice at the type level, either. You often

solve type errors by making a function accept a narrower type for its parameters, and

that’s exactly what we want to do here. You can add a constraint on type parameters

using the extends keyword:

```
type MyPick<T extends object, K extends keyof T> = {[P in K]: T[P]};
```
```
type AgeOnly = MyPick<Person, 'age'>;
// ^? type AgeOnly = { age: number; }
type FirstNameOnly = MyPick<Person, 'firstName'>;
// ~~~~~~~~~~~
// Type '"firstName"' does not satisfy the constraint 'keyof Person'.
type Flip = MyPick<'age', Person>;
// ~~~~~ Type 'string' does not satisfy the constraint 'object'.
```
By constraining T to be an object type and constraining K to be a subtype of the keys

of T, we’ve solved two problems at once: we’ve eliminated the type errors in the imple‐

mentation and we’ve produced type errors on the invalid instantiations of MyPick.

When you have noImplicitAny set, TypeScript requires that you provide type anno‐

tations for all function parameters. There’s no equivalent of this for type parameters.

If you don’t specify a constraint, it defaults to unknown, which allows users to pass in

any type whatsoever. When you’re defining a generic type, consider whether you want

to give your users a bit less freedom and a bit more safety.

When you write a function, you choose descriptive parameter names and write

TSDoc comments (Item 68). You should do that for generic types as well. There’s a

convention of using one-letter names for type parameters (as this item has), but you

should be just as wary of these in type-level code as you would be of one-letter vari‐

able names.

The general rule of thumb in naming is that the length of a name should match its

scope. Long-lived globals should have long, descriptive names, whereas short names

like i, k, or v can actually improve legibility in a concise arrow function with limited

scope. For a short generic like MyPick, T and K are fine. But for a longer definition

where the type parameter has broader scope (a generic class, say), a longer, more

meaningful name will improve clarity.

You can write TSDoc for generic types and the TypeScript language service will sur‐

face it in relevant situations, just as it would for functions. The type-level equivalent

of @param is @template:^1

**218 | Chapter 6: Generics and Type-Level Programming**


##### /**

```
* Construct a new object type using a subset of the properties of another one
* (same as the built-in `Pick` type).
* @template T The original object type
* @template K The keys to pick, typically a union of string literal types.
*/
type MyPick<T extends object, K extends keyof T> = {
[P in K]: T[P]
};
```
If you inspect MyPick at an instantiation site, you’ll get the full documentation. And if

you mouse over T or K in the definition, you’ll see the documentation for just that

type parameter (Figure 6-1).

Figure 6-1. The _@template_ TSDoc tag can be used to document a type parameter.

TypeScript types are best thought of as sets of values (Item 7), so generic types inher‐

ently operate on sets. This is quite distinct from JavaScript functions where you know

that each parameter will have a single value every time the function is called. In prac‐

tice this means that you always need to think about how your generic type will behave

with union types. Item 53 shows you how to do this.

You write tests for your value-level code, what about for your type-level code? You

absolutely should test your types! This is an interesting and deep enough topic that it

warrants its own item. Check out Item 55.

You can also add type parameters to some value-level constructs such as functions

and classes. We might accompany our Pick generic type with a corresponding pick

function, for example:

```
function pick<T extends object, K extends keyof T>(
obj: T, ...keys: K[]
): Pick<T, K> {
const picked: Partial<Pick<T, K>> = {};
for ( const k of keys) {
picked[k] = obj[k];
}
return picked as Pick<T, K>;
}
```
```
Item 50: Think of Generics as Functions Between Types | 219
```

```
const p: Person = { name: 'Matilda', age: 5.5 };
const age = pick(p, 'age');
// ^? const age: Pick<Person, "age">
console.log(age); // logs { age: 5.5 }
```
Just looking at the type and ignoring the bits between the parentheses, this looks a lot

like the definition of the MyPick type from earlier:

```
type P = typeof pick;
// ^? type P = <T extends object, K extends keyof T>(
// obj: T, ...keys: K[]
// ) => Pick<T, K>
```
You can think of generic functions as conceptually defining an associated generic

type. The beauty of generic functions, however, is that TypeScript can often infer the

type parameters from the values when the function is called. In the previous example,

we just wrote pick(p, 'age'). This is significantly more concise than (and produces

the exact same results as) writing out the types explicitly:

```
const age = pick<Person, 'age'>(p, 'age');
// ^? const age: Pick<Person, "age">
```
Another advantage is that the user of your pick function needn’t know that they’re

working with generic types or type-level operations at all. They can just enjoy the

accurate, precise types. The type of age is a hint that there’s type-level programming

at work, but this, too, can be hidden if you like. Item 56 shows how.

Classes can also take type parameters, and these, too, can be inferred from usage:

```
class Box<T> {
value: T;
constructor (value: T) {
this .value = value;
}
}
```
```
const dateBox = new Box( new Date());
// ^? const dateBox: Box<Date>
```
Recall from Item 8 that class is one of the few constructs in TypeScript that introdu‐

ces both a type and a value. For a generic class, it introduces a generic type that relates

the type parameter (T) to the properties and methods of that class.

Just as classes are good at capturing related bits of state that you’d otherwise have to

track yourself, generic classes are a good way to capture types. A generic class’s type

parameters are set when it’s constructed and they don’t need to be passed to its meth‐

ods when you call them (though its methods can have type parameters of their own).

Item 28 explored how this could be used to gain more fine-grained control over type

inference.

**220 | Chapter 6: Generics and Type-Level Programming**


In value-land, you can write “higher order functions” like map, filter, and reduce

that take other functions as parameters. This gives you enormous flexibility to factor

out shared behaviors. Is there a type-level equivalent of these?

At the time of this writing, the answer is no. These would be “functions on functions

on types” or “higher-kinded types” as they’re usually known. They would let you fac‐

tor out common operations, like applying a generic type to the value types in an

object:

```
type MapValues<T extends object, F> = {
[K in keyof T]: F<T[K]>;
// ~~~~~~~ Type 'F' is not generic.
};
```
The good news is that this doesn’t limit what you can do with generic types. It only

limits the way you express yourself. In this case, you need to use a mapped type

instead of MapValues. Similarly, there’s no such thing as an anonymous generic type.

Generic types are best thought of as functions between types. Keep this in mind as

you write them. You’re working at the type level now and it’s exciting and new. But

you’re still coding, and all the best practices you’ve learned for writing value-level

code still apply.

**Things to Remember**

- Think of generic types as functions between types.
- Use extends to constrain the domain of type parameters, just as you’d use a type
    annotation to constrain a function parameter.
- Choose type parameter names that increase the legibility of your code, and write
    TSDoc for them.
- Think of generic functions and classes as conceptually defining generic types that
    are conducive to type inference.

### Item 51: Avoid Unnecessary Type Parameters

Here’s what the official TypeScript Handbook has to say about generic functions:

```
Writing generic functions is fun, and it can be easy to get carried away with type
parameters. Having too many type parameters or using constraints where they aren’t
needed can make inference less successful, frustrating callers of your function.
```
```
Item 51: Avoid Unnecessary Type Parameters | 221
```

It goes on to offer a few specific pieces of advice about how to use generics, including

one that is sometimes called the “Golden Rule of Generics”:

```
Type Parameters Should Appear Twice
Type parameters are for relating the types of multiple values. If a type parameter is only
used once in the function signature, it’s not relating anything.
Rule: If a type parameter only appears in one location, strongly reconsider if you
actually need it.
```
This rule gives you a specific way to tell whether any type parameter is good or bad,

but it’s not always obvious how to apply it, and it doesn’t offer much guidance about

how to rework your code if you’re using generics poorly. In this item we’ll go through

a few examples of good and bad uses of generics to illustrate how the rule works, and

we’ll rewrite the bad ones.

Let’s start with the identity function:

```
function identity<T>(arg: T): T {
return arg;
}
```
This function takes a single parameter and returns it, leaving its type unaltered. Here’s

how you might use it:

```
const date = identity( new Date());
// ^? const date: Date
const nums = [1, 2, 3];
// ^? const nums: number[]
const numsCopy = nums.map(identity);
// ^? const numsCopy: number[]
```
This function can be useful in practice if you’re required to pass in a callback but you

don’t want to alter your data. Thinking about the Golden Rule, is this a good use of

generics or a bad use? In this example, the type parameter T appears in two places

after its declaration:

```
function identity<T>(arg: T): T {
// (decl.) 1 2
return arg;
}
```
So this passes the test and is a good use of generics. And rightly so: it relates two types

because it says that the input parameter’s type and the function’s return type are the

same.

How about this one?

```
function third<A, B, C>(a: A, b: B, c: C): C {
return c;
}
```
**222 | Chapter 6: Generics and Type-Level Programming**


```
2 There are a few any-returning functions in the standard library, such as JSON.parse. See Item 71 for a discus‐
sion of how to make them return unknown instead.
```
The type parameter C appears twice, so it’s fine. But A and B only appear once (other

than in their declarations), so this function fails the test. You can rewrite it using only

one type parameter:

```
function third<C>(a: unknown , b: unknown , c: C): C {
return c;
}
```
Here’s a type declaration for a function that parses YAML:

```
declare function parseYAML<T>(input: string ): T;
```
Is this a good use of generics or a bad use of generics? The type parameter T only

appears once, so it must be bad. How to fix it? It depends what your goal is. These so-

called “return-only generics” are dangerous because they’re equivalent to a type asser‐

tion (Item 9), but don’t use the word as:

```
interface Weight {
pounds: number ;
ounces: number ;
}
```
```
const w: Weight = parseYAML('');
```
At first blush, this code looks safe because there are no type assertions or any types.

But this is an illusion. You could replace Weight with any other type and this code

would still type check. Setting a default value for the type parameter doesn’t change

this:

```
declare function parseYAML<T= null >(input: string ): T;
const w: Weight = parseYAML(''); // still allowed
```
It’s better to make this function return unknown instead (see Item 46 for a refresher on

the unknown type):

```
declare function parseYAML(input: string ): unknown ;
```
This will force users of the function to perform a type assertion on the result:

```
const w = parseYAML('') as Weight;
```
This is actually a good thing since it forces you to be explicit about your unsafe type

assertion. There are no illusions of type safety here!^2

How about this one?

```
function printProperty<T, K extends keyof T>(obj: T, key: K) {
console.log(obj[key]);
}
```
```
Item 51: Avoid Unnecessary Type Parameters | 223
```

Since K only appears once, this is a bad use of generics (T is fine because it appears

both as a parameter type and as a constraint on K). Fix it by moving the keyof T into

the parameter type and eliminating K:

```
function printProperty<T>(obj: T, key: keyof T) {
console.log(obj[key]);
}
```
This function looks superficially similar:

```
function getProperty<T, K extends keyof T>(obj: T, key: K) {
return obj[key];
}
```
This one, however, is actually a good use of generics. To see why, we need to look at

the inferred return type of the function. If you inspect getProperty in your editor,

you’ll see that its return type is T[K]. That means this signature is equivalent to:

```
function getProperty<T, K extends keyof T>(obj: T, key: K): T[K] {
return obj[key];
}
```
So K does appear twice! This is a good use of generics: K is related to T, and the return

type is related to both K and T.

What about a class?

```
class ClassyArray<T> {
arr: T[];
constructor (arr: T[]) { this .arr = arr; }
```
```
get(): T[] { return this .arr; }
add(item: T) { this .arr.push(item); }
remove(item: T) {
this .arr = this .arr.filter(el => el !== item)
}
}
```
This is fine since T appears many times in the implementation (I count 5). When you

instantiate a ClassyArray, you bind the type parameter and it relates the types of all

the properties and methods on the class. (This can be useful for creating inference

sites, as we saw in Item 28.)

This class, on the other hand, fails the test:

```
class Joiner<T extends string | number > {
join(els: T[]) {
return els.map(el => String(el)).join(',');
}
}
```
First of all, T only applies to join, so it can be moved down onto the method, rather

than the class:

**224 | Chapter 6: Generics and Type-Level Programming**


```
3 There’s a famous adage for object-oriented programmers: “Don’t make objects that end with er.”
```
```
class Joiner {
join<T extends string | number >(els: T[]) {
return els.map(el => String(el)).join(',');
}
}
```
By moving the declaration of T closer to its use, we make it possible for TypeScript to

infer the type of T. Generally, this is what you want! But in this case, since T only

appears once, you should make it nongeneric:

```
class Joiner {
join(els: ( string | number )[]) {
return els.map(el => String(el)).join(',');
}
}
```
Finally, why does this need to be a class at all? These sorts of wrapper classes are com‐

mon in Java (which doesn’t support standalone functions) but they’re unnecessary in

JavaScript.^3 Make it a standalone function instead:

```
function join(els: ( string | number )[]) {
return els.map(el => String(el)).join(',');
}
```
How about this function to get the length of any array-like object?

```
interface Lengthy {
length: number ;
}
function getLength<T extends Lengthy>(x: T) {
return x.length;
}
```
Since T only appears once after its definition, this is a bad use of generics. It could be

written as:

```
function getLength(x: Lengthy) {
return x.length;
}
```
or even:

```
function getLength(x: {length: number }) {
return x.length;
}
```
Or, since TypeScript has a built-in ArrayLike type:

```
function getLength(x: ArrayLike< unknown >) {
return x.length;
}
```
```
Item 51: Avoid Unnecessary Type Parameters | 225
```

Every rule has exceptions, so are there any exceptions to this one? There are some

rare cases where extraneous type parameters can help you get an implementation

right. For example, both type parameters in this function are bad:

```
declare function processUnrelatedTypes<A, B>(a: A, b: B): void ;
```
The fix is to rewrite it this way:

```
declare function processUnrelatedTypes(a: unknown , b: unknown ): void ;
```
This has a consequence for the implementation of the function, however. In the first

declaration, a and b were not assignable to one another in the body of the function:

```
function processUnrelatedTypes<A, B>(a: A, b: B) {
a = b;
// ~ Type 'B' is not assignable to type 'A'.
b = a;
// ~ Type 'A' is not assignable to type 'B'.
}
```
With the improved type signature, they are:

```
function processUnrelatedTypes(a: unknown , b: unknown ) {
a = b; // ok
b = a; // ok
}
```
A workaround is to use a single overload to create a distinct type signature for callers

versus the implementation. Item 52 shows what this looks like. As a general rule,

however, this sort of situation is rare, and you should avoid generic type parameters

that only appear once.

By now you should have a good sense for how to apply the golden rule of generics

and how to fix the declarations that break it. As you read and write generic functions,

think about whether they follow this rule! If a function or class doesn’t need to be

generic, then it will be easier to understand and maintain if it isn’t.

Put another way, the first rule of generics is “don’t.”

**Things to Remember**

- Avoid adding type parameters to functions and classes that don’t need them.
- Since type parameters relate types, every type parameter must appear two or
    more times to establish a relationship.
- Remember that a type parameter may appear in an inferred type.
- Avoid “return-only generics.”
- Unneeded type parameters can often be replaced with the unknown type.

**226 | Chapter 6: Generics and Type-Level Programming**


### Item 52: Prefer Conditional Types to Overload Signatures

How would you write a type declaration for this JavaScript function?

```
function double (x) {
return x + x;
}
```
double can be passed either a string or a number. So you might use a union type:

```
declare function double (x: string | number ): string | number ;
```
While this declaration is accurate, it’s a bit imprecise:

```
const num = double (12);
// ^? const num: string | number
const str = double ('x');
// ^? const str: string | number
```
When double is passed a number, it returns a number. And when it’s passed a string,

it returns a string. This declaration misses that nuance and will produce types that

are inconvenient to work with.

You might try to capture this relationship by making the function generic:

```
declare function double <T extends string | number >(x: T): T;
```
```
const num = double (12);
// ^? const num: 12
const str = double ('x');
// ^? const str: "x"
```
Unfortunately, in our zeal for precision we’ve overshot. The types are now a little too

precise. When passed a string type, this double declaration will result in a string

type, which is correct. But when passed a string literal type, the return type is the

same string literal type. This is wrong: doubling 'x' results in 'xx', not 'x'. As Item

40 explained, imprecise types are preferable to inaccurate types, so this is a step in the

wrong direction. How can we do better?

Another option is to provide multiple type declarations, also known as “overload sig‐

natures” (see Item 3 for a refresher). While JavaScript only allows you to write one

implementation of a function, TypeScript allows you to write any number of type sig‐

natures. You can use this to improve the type of double:

```
declare function double (x: number ): number ;
declare function double (x: string ): string ;
```
```
const num = double (12);
// ^? const num: number
const str = double ('x');
// ^? const str: string
```
```
Item 52: Prefer Conditional Types to Overload Signatures | 227
```

This is progress! But there’s still a subtle bug. This type declaration will work with val‐

ues that are either a string or a number, but not with values that could be either:

```
function f(x: string | number ) {
return double (x);
// ~ Argument of type 'string | number' is not assignable
// to parameter of type 'string'
}
```
This call to double is safe and should return string|number. When you provide

overload signatures, TypeScript processes them one by one until it finds a match. The

error you’re seeing is a result of the last overload (the string version) failing, because

string|number is not assignable to string.

While you could fix this by adding a third string|number overload, a better solution

is to use a conditional type. Conditional types are like if statements (conditionals) in

type space. They’re perfect for situations like this one where there are a few possibili‐

ties that you need to cover:

```
declare function double <T extends string | number >(
x: T
): T extends string? string : number ;
```
This is similar to the first attempt to type double using a generic function, but with a

more elaborate return type. You read the conditional type like you’d read a ternary

(?:) operator in JavaScript:

- If T is a subtype of string (i.e., string, or a string literal, or a union of string
    literals, or a template literal type), then the return type is string.
- Otherwise return number.

With this declaration, all of our examples work:

```
const num = double (12);
// ^? const num: number
const str = double ('x');
// ^? const str: string
```
```
function f(x: string | number ) {
// ^? function f(x: string | number): string | number
return double (x); // ok
}
```
The string|number example works because conditional types distribute over unions.

When T is string|number, TypeScript resolves the conditional type as follows:

```
(string|number) extends string? string : number
→ (string extends string? string : number) |
(number extends string? string : number)
→ string | number
```
**228 | Chapter 6: Generics and Type-Level Programming**


The way that conditional types distribute over unions is part of the design of Type‐

Script’s type system. It didn’t have to be this way. But in many cases (such as this one),

this behavior is correct and extremely convenient.

While the type declaration using overload signatures was simpler to write, the version

using conditional types is more correct because it generalizes to the union of the indi‐

vidual cases. This is often the case for overload signatures. Whereas overloads are

treated independently, the type checker can analyze conditional types as a single

expression, distributing them over unions.

Whenever you write a conditional type, you should think about whether you want it

to distribute over unions. Usually you do, but this isn’t always the case. Item 53

presents a situation where distribution is incorrect and shows how you can gain some

control over it.

Are there any situations where you should prefer overloads? If the union case is

implausible, or if your function really acts as two or more very distinct functions with

completely different signatures, then it may not be worth the effort to handle it, and

keeping the distinct overloads separate will result in more readable code.

If you find yourself in this situation, though, think about whether it would be clearer

to have two different functions. An example of this comes from the Node standard

library, which offers both callback- and Promise-based versions of filesystem func‐

tions like readFile. This could be a single function that behaves differently depend‐

ing on its arguments. But you generally know in advance whether you’re using

callbacks or Promises, so it’s clearer and simpler to have two distinct functions.

Since this is a chapter on type-level programming, we’ve focused entirely on the

types. But it’s worth briefly discussing how to implement overloaded functions and

functions that return conditional types. This can often be awkward and require type

assertions in the function body. TypeScript will not infer a conditional type for a

variable.

One strategy is to define a single overload to present a different type signature to call‐

ers than you use to implement the function. For example:

```
function double <T extends string | number >(
x: T
): T extends string? string : number ;
function double (x: string | number ): string | number {
return typeof x === 'string'? x + x : x + x ;
}
```
Here we use the conditional type for the externally visible API, but use a simpler type

for the implementation. (The typeof check looks a bit odd but saves us a type asser‐

tion.) TypeScript does some checking that the two signatures are compatible, but it

cannot do a perfect job. It’s still important to test your types, as explained in Item 55.

```
Item 52: Prefer Conditional Types to Overload Signatures | 229
```

**Things to Remember**

- Prefer conditional types to overloaded type signatures. By distributing over
    unions, conditional types allow your declarations to support union types without
    additional overloads.
- If the union case is implausible, consider whether your function would be clearer
    as two or more functions with different names.
- Consider using the single overload strategy for implementing functions declared
    with conditional types.

#### Item 53: Know How to Control the Distribution of Unions

#### over Conditional Types

Item 52 looked at how conditional types distribute over unions, and how this could

be helpful in typing a double function:

```
declare function double <T extends number | string >(
x: T
): T extends string? string : number ;
```
```
const num = double (12);
// ^? const num: number
const str = double ('x');
// ^? const str: string
```
```
declare let numOrStr: number | string ;
const either = double (numOrStr);
// ^? const either: number | string
```
In this case, the distribution over unions produced the desired result. This is typically,

but not always, the case.

To see an example of where distribution is not desirable, let’s define an isLessThan

function that determines whether its first argument is less than the second. We’d like

it to operate on dates, numbers, and strings. As a convenience, if you pass a Date in as

the first argument, we’d like to allow you to pass a number (milliseconds since epoch)

as the second argument.

You can model this using a conditional type:

```
type Comparable<T> =
T extends Date? Date | number :
T extends number? number :
T extends string? string :
never ;
```
```
declare function isLessThan<T>(a: T, b: Comparable<T>): boolean ;
```
**230 | Chapter 6: Generics and Type-Level Programming**


This seems to allow and disallow the combinations that we expect:

```
isLessThan( new Date(), new Date()); // ok
isLessThan( new Date(), Date.now()); // ok, Date/number comparison allowed
isLessThan(12, 23); // ok
isLessThan('A', 'B'); // ok
isLessThan(12, 'B');
// ~~~ Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter
// of type 'number'.
```
Because of the way it’s written, Comparable distributes over unions. Is this desirable?

Evidently not:

```
let dateOrStr = Math.random() < 0.5? new Date() : 'A';
// ^? let dateOrStr: Date | string
isLessThan(dateOrStr, 'B') // ok, but should be an error
```
The second parameter should really be the intersection of the two possibilities, not

the union. And (Date | number) & string is never, so this call shouldn’t be allowed

at all.

How can we prevent distribution? Unions only distribute over conditional types if the

condition is a bare type (T extends ...). So to prevent distribution, we need to com‐

plicate the expression a bit. The standard way to do this is to wrap T in a one-element

tuple type, [T]:

```
type Comparable<T> =
[T] extends [Date]? Date | number :
[T] extends [ number ]? number :
[T] extends [ string ]? string :
never ;
```
The type [A] is assignable to [B] if and only if A is assignable to B. So on the surface

this change doesn’t look like it should affect the behavior of Comparable. But since

[T] is not a bare type, unions no longer distribute over Comparable and we get the

desired errors without breaking the other valid calls:

```
isLessThan( new Date(), new Date()); // ok
isLessThan( new Date(), Date.now()); // ok, Date/number comparison allowed
isLessThan(12, 23); // ok
isLessThan('A', 'B'); // ok
isLessThan(12, 'B');
// ~~~ Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter
// of type 'number'.
isLessThan(dateOrStr, 'B');
// ~~~ Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to
// parameter of type 'never'.
```
Sometimes the situation is reversed and you have a conditional type that doesn’t dis‐

tribute but you’d like it to. This typically occurs as an inadvertent consequence of the

way that the generic type was implemented.

```
Item 53: Know How to Control the Distribution of Unions over Conditional Types | 231
```

To see how this might happen, let’s implement a generic type, NTuple<T, N>, that

produces a tuple with N elements, all of type T. This is a step up in complexity from

the types we’ve seen before, but we’ll talk our way through it. Here’s one way to do it

using an accumulator:

```
type NTuple<T, N extends number > = NTupleHelp<T, N, []>;
```
```
type NTupleHelp<T, N extends number , Acc extends T[]> =
Acc['length'] extends N
? Acc
: NTupleHelp<T, N, [T, ...Acc]>;
```
The trick here is to keep adding elements to a tuple type until its length property

matches the number that we want. Remember that this lookup is happening in the

type system. Looking up 'length' on an array type will yield number, but for a tuple

type it will yield a more precise numeric literal type like 0 , 1 , 2 , etc.

This generic type works as we’d hope for constructing N-tuples if N is a single number:

```
type PairOfStrings = NTuple< string , 2>;
// ^? type PairOfStrings = [string, string]
type TripleOfNumbers = NTuple< number , 3>;
// ^? type TripleOfNumbers = [number, number, number]
```
But it does not work as we’d hope if N is a union:

```
type PairOrTriple = NTuple<bigint, 2 | 3>;
// ^? type PairOrTriple = [bigint, bigint]
```
This should be [bigint, bigint] | [bigint, bigint, bigint]. The immediate

issue is that Acc['length'] extends 2 | 3 is true as soon as the accumulator gets to

be a pair. But the deeper issue is that our conditional type isn’t distributing over

unions. We’d like it to. Why isn’t it, and how can we fix it?

The problem is that the condition is Acc['length'] extends N, which does not start

with the bare “N extends...” that’s required for distribution. So the easiest fix is to add

an extra conditional type that looks like this:

```
type NTuple<T, N extends number > =
N extends number
? NTupleHelp<T, N, []>
: never ;
```
Because N is constrained to extend number, this conditional will always evaluate to

true (you could make it N extends any or N extends unknown if you like). Its sole

purpose is to add a conditional type in the right form for distribution. And it works!

```
type PairOrTriple = NTuple<bigint, 2 | 3>;
// ^? type PairOrTriple = [bigint, bigint] | [bigint, bigint, bigint]
```
**232 | Chapter 6: Generics and Type-Level Programming**


```
4 A remaining issue with this definition is that NTuple<string, number> is [], but it should be string[]. Try
fixing it without breaking existing behavior.
```
This happens because NTupleHelp is instantiated with N = 2 and N = 3 and the

results are unioned together. Using an accumulator is a common technique with

recursive generic types because it can improve their performance. Item 57 will

explain how.^4

Conditional types have two other surprising behaviors that you should be aware of

when they distribute over the boolean and never types.

First, boolean. Let’s define a generic type that yields a celebratory message if its argu‐

ment is true:

```
type CelebrateIfTrue<V> = V extends true? 'Huzzah!' : never ;
```
```
type Party = CelebrateIfTrue< true >;
// ^? type Party = "Huzzah!"
type NoParty = CelebrateIfTrue< false >;
// ^? type NoParty = never
type SurpriseParty = CelebrateIfTrue< boolean >;
// ^? type SurpriseParty = "Huzzah!"
```
It’s surprising that this last instantiation resolves to "Huzzah!" because you wouldn’t

expect boolean extends true to be true. What’s going on is a bit more subtle. Inter‐

nally, TypeScript treats boolean as a union:

```
type boolean = true | false ;
```
Because boolean is a union, it can distribute over conditional types. So spelling it out

a bit, the evaluation looks like this:

```
type SurpriseParty
= CelebrateIfTrue< boolean >
= CelebrateIfTrue< true | false >
= CelebrateIfTrue< true > | CelebrateIfTrue< false >
= "Huzzah!" | never
= "Huzzah!";
```
In this case, it’s probably not what you wanted. As before, you can prevent distribu‐

tion by wrapping the condition in a one-tuple:

```
type CelebrateIfTrue<V> = [V] extends [ true ]? 'Huzzah!' : never ;
```
```
type SurpriseParty = CelebrateIfTrue< boolean >;
// ^? type SurpriseParty = never
```
Another surprise comes with the never type. Looking at this definition, you’d expect

AllowIn<T> to always evaluate to either "Yes", "No" or possibly "Yes" | "No":

```
type AllowIn<T> = T extends {password: "open-sesame"}? "Yes" : "No";
```
```
Item 53: Know How to Control the Distribution of Unions over Conditional Types | 233
```

But there’s one other possibility if T is never:

```
type N = AllowIn< never >;
// ^? type N = never
```
Why does this evaluate to never if neither side of the conditional is never? Again, it’s

all about distribution over unions. TypeScript treats the never type as an empty

union and, if there’s nothing to distribute over, you get empty back. This might make

a bit more sense if you replace T with T|never (which is the same as T) and see what

happens:

```
AllowIn<T>
= AllowIn<T | never >
= AllowIn<T> | AllowIn< never >
= AllowIn<T> | never
= AllowIn<T>
```
Surely T|never should be treated the same as T. And when distribution applies, this

means that F<never> must be never, regardless of how you define F. As before, if you

don’t want this, one solution is to wrap your condition in a one-tuple.

The way that conditional types distribute over unions is one of their most powerful

and useful capabilities. It is usually, but not always, the behavior that you want. When

you write a generic type, think about whether you want it to distribute over unions,

and be aware of how seemingly innocuous refactors can enable or disable

distribution.

**Things to Remember**

- Think about whether you want unions to distribute over your conditional types.
- Know how to enable or disable distribution by adding conditions or by wrapping
    conditions in one-tuples.
- Be aware of the surprising behavior of boolean and never types when they dis‐
    tribute over unions.

#### Item 54: Use Template Literal Types to Model DSLs and

#### Relationships Between Strings

Item 35 suggested using more precise alternatives to string types in your own code.

But there are many strings in the world and it’s hard to avoid them entirely. In these

cases, TypeScript offers its own unique tool for capturing patterns and relationships

in strings: template literal types. This item will explore how this feature works and

how you can use it to bring safety to code that would be impossible to type otherwise.

**234 | Chapter 6: Generics and Type-Level Programming**


Like all programming languages, TypeScript has a string type but, as we’ve seen in

previous items, it also has string literal types, which are types whose domain consists

of a single string value. These are often combined with unions:

```
type MedalColor = 'gold' | 'silver' | 'bronze';
```
With unions of string literal types, you can model finite sets of strings. With string

itself you can capture the infinite set all possible strings. Template literal types let you

model something in between, for example, the set of all strings starting with pseudo:

```
type PseudoString = `pseudo${ string }`;
const science: PseudoString = 'pseudoscience'; // ok
const alias: PseudoString = 'pseudonym'; // ok
const physics: PseudoString = 'physics';
// ~~~~~~~ Type '"physics"' is not assignable to type '`pseudo${string}`'.
```
Like string, the PseudoString type has an infinite domain (Item 7). But unlike

string, values in the PseudoString type have some structure: they all start with

pseudo. As with other type-level constructs, the syntax for template literal types is

deliberately meant to evoke JavaScript’s template literals.

JavaScript abounds with structured strings. For example, what if you want to require

that an object have some known set of properties, but also allow any others that start

with data-? (This pattern is common with the DOM.)

```
interface Checkbox {
id: string ;
checked: boolean ;
[key: `data-${ string }`]: unknown ;
}
```
```
const check1: Checkbox = {
id: 'subscribe',
checked: true ,
value: 'yes',
// ~~~~ Object literal may only specify known properties,
// and 'value' does not exist in type 'Checkbox'.
'data-listIds': 'all-the-lists', // ok
};
const check2: Checkbox = {
id: 'subscribe',
checked: true ,
listIds: 'all-the-lists',
// ~~~~~~ Object literal may only specify known properties,
// and 'listIds' does not exist in type 'Checkbox'
};
```
Had we used string as the index type, we’d lose the benefit of excess property check‐

ing on check1 (see Item 11) and incorrectly permit the property without a data-

prefix on check2:

```
Item 54: Use Template Literal Types to Model DSLs and Relationships Between Strings | 235
```

```
interface Checkbox {
id: string ;
checked: boolean ;
[key: string ]: unknown ;
}
```
```
const check1: Checkbox = {
id: 'subscribe',
checked: true ,
value: 'yes', // permitted
'data-listIds': 'all-the-lists',
};
const check2: Checkbox = {
id: 'subscribe',
checked: true ,
listIds: 'all-the-lists' // also permitted, matches index type
};
```
Template literal types are helpful for modeling subsets of string, but their real power

comes when we combine them with generics and type inference to capture relation‐

ships between types.

Consider the querySelector function provided by the DOM. TypeScript is already

clever enough to give you a more specific subtype of HTMLElement if you query for it:

```
const img = document.querySelector('img');
// ^? const img: HTMLImageElement | null
```
This allows you to access img.src, for example, which would not be permitted on the

less specific Element type. (Item 75 covers TypeScript and the DOM.)

This cleverness is not very deep, though. If you try to query for an image with a spe‐

cific ID, you’ll just get an Element:

```
const img = document.querySelector('img#spectacular-sunset');
// ^? const img: Element | null
img?.src
// ~~~ Property 'src' does not exist on type 'Element'.
```
With the help of template literal types, we can make this work. TypeScript’s type dec‐

larations for the DOM (lib.dom.d.ts) include a mapping from tag name to type:

```
interface HTMLElementTagNameMap {
"a": HTMLAnchorElement;
"abbr": HTMLElement;
"address": HTMLElement;
"area": HTMLAreaElement;
// ... many more ...
"video": HTMLVideoElement;
"wbr": HTMLElement;
}
```
**236 | Chapter 6: Generics and Type-Level Programming**


```
5 Since E only appears once in this declaration, it’s a bad use of a type parameter. See Item 51.
```
as well as a few declarations for querySelector:^5

```
interface ParentNode extends Node {
// ...
querySelector<E extends Element = Element>(selectors: string ): E | null ;
// ...
}
```
Now we can use a template literal type to add an overload for the tag#id case:

```
type HTMLTag = keyof HTMLElementTagNameMap;
declare global {
interface ParentNode {
querySelector<
TagName extends HTMLTag
>(
selector: `${TagName}#${ string }`
): HTMLElementTagNameMap[TagName] | null ;
}
}
```
The example from before now works as you’d hope, returning the more precise image

type and allowing access to its src property:

```
const img = document.querySelector('img#spectacular-sunset');
// ^? const img: HTMLImageElement | null
img?.src // ok
```
This is helpful, but we’ve slightly missed the mark:

```
const img = document.querySelector('div#container img');
// ^? const img: HTMLDivElement | null
```
A space in a CSS selector means “descendant of.” In this case, our template literal type

`${TagName}#${string}` matched "div", then "#", then "container img". In

attempting to get more precise types, we’ve run afoul of Item 40’s advice to prefer

imprecision to inaccuracy.

While one could imagine building an entire CSS selector parser using template literal

types, a less ambitious way to handle this issue is to guard against characters with

special meanings in CSS selectors using another overload:

```
type CSSSpecialChars = ' ' | '>' | '+' | '~' | '||' | ',';
type HTMLTag = keyof HTMLElementTagNameMap;
```
```
declare global {
interface ParentNode {
// escape hatch
querySelector(
selector: `${HTMLTag}#${ string }${CSSSpecialChars}${ string }`
```
```
Item 54: Use Template Literal Types to Model DSLs and Relationships Between Strings | 237
```

```
): Element | null ;
```
```
// same as before
querySelector<
TagName extends HTMLTag
>(
selector: `${TagName}#${ string }`
): HTMLElementTagNameMap[TagName] | null ;
}
}
```
Now you at least get an imprecise type for the more complex selector, rather than an

inaccurate type:

```
const img = document.querySelector('img#spectacular-sunset');
// ^? const img: HTMLImageElement | null
const img2 = document.querySelector('div#container img');
// ^? const img2: Element | null
```
This will help ensure safe usage. For more on TypeScript and the DOM, see Item 75.

Template literal types are often combined with conditional types to implement pars‐

ers for domain-specific languages (DSLs) like CSS selectors. To see how this works,

let’s try to get precise types for an objectToCamel function that camelCases the keys

of a snake_cased object:

```
// e.g. foo_bar -> fooBar
function camelCase(term: string ) {
return term.replace(/_([a-z])/g, m => m[1].toUpperCase());
}
```
```
// (return type to be filled in shortly)
function objectToCamel<T extends object>(obj: T) {
const out: any = {};
for ( const [k, v] of Object.entries(obj)) {
out[camelCase(k)] = v;
}
return out;
}
```
```
const snake = {foo_bar: 12};
// ^? const snake: { foo_bar: number; }
const camel = objectToCamel(snake);
// camel's value at runtime is {fooBar: 12};
// we'd like the type to be {fooBar: number}
const val = camel.fooBar; // we'd like this to have a number type
const val2 = camel.foo_bar; // we'd like this to be an error
```
Let’s start by defining a type-level ToCamelOnce helper:

```
type ToCamelOnce<S extends string > =
S extends `${ infer Head}_${ infer Tail}`
? `${Head}${Capitalize<Tail>}`
```
**238 | Chapter 6: Generics and Type-Level Programming**


##### : S;

```
type T = ToCamelOnce<'foo_bar'>; // type is "fooBar"
```
Here we’ve used the infer keyword in a conditional type to extract the part of the

string before and after an underscore. When S is "foo_bar", then Head is the string

literal type "foo" and Tail is the string literal type "bar". When we get a match, we

construct a new string (using a template literal type) without the underscore and with

the first letter of the tail capitalized (Capitalize is a built-in helper).

To make this work on strings with multiple underscores like "foo_bar_baz", we need

to make it recursive:

```
type ToCamel<S extends string > =
S extends `${ infer Head}_${ infer Tail}`
? `${Head}${Capitalize<ToCamel<Tail>>}`
: S;
type T0 = ToCamel<'foo'>; // type is "foo"
type T1 = ToCamel<'foo_bar'>; // type is "fooBar"
type T2 = ToCamel<'foo_bar_baz'>; // type is "fooBarBaz"
```
Now we can give objectToCamel a more precise type using a mapped type (Item 15)

that rewrites the keys using the helper:

```
type ObjectToCamel<T extends object> = {
[K in keyof T as ToCamel<K & string >]: T[K]
};
```
```
function objectToCamel<T extends object>(obj: T): ObjectToCamel<T> {
// ... as before ...
}
```
And now the types are exactly what we wanted!

```
const snake = {foo_bar: 12};
// ^? const snake: { foo_bar: number; }
const camel = objectToCamel(snake);
// ^? const camel: ObjectToCamel<{ foo_bar: number; }>
// (equivalent to { fooBar: number; })
const val = camel.fooBar;
// ^? const val: number
const val2 = camel.foo_bar;
// ~~~~~~~ Property 'foo_bar' does not exist on type
// '{ fooBar: number; }'. Did you mean 'fooBar'?
```
This new, more precise type for objectToCamel is an excellent example of “fancy”

TypeScript features being used to benefit a developer. You don’t need to know any‐

thing about template literal types, conditional types, or mapped types to use objectTo

Camel. But you still benefit from them in the form of more precise types. Your

experience of TypeScript is that it understands this code even if you don’t understand

precisely how it does that.

```
Item 54: Use Template Literal Types to Model DSLs and Relationships Between Strings | 239
```

One small issue is that the display of the camel’s type isn’t ideal. Item 56 will explain

how to improve it.

**Things to Remember**

- Use template literal types to model structured subsets of string types and
    domain-specific languages (DSLs).
- Combine template literal types with mapped and conditional types to capture
    nuanced relationships between types.
- Take care to avoid crossing the line into inaccurate types. Strive for uses of tem‐
    plate literal types that improve developer experience without requiring knowl‐
    edge of fancy language features.

### Item 55: Write Tests for Your Types

```
Write tests until fear is transformed into boredom.
—Phlip (quoted in Kent Beck, Test Driven Development: By Example [Addison-Wesley
Professional])
```
You wouldn’t write code without tests (I hope!), and you shouldn’t write type declara‐

tions without writing tests for them either. But how do you test types? If you’re

authoring type declarations or a TypeScript library, testing your types is an essential,

but surprisingly fraught, undertaking.

This is a particularly acute need for TypeScript compared to most other program‐

ming languages for two reasons:

- TypeScript lets you put an enormous amount of logic in the types. Where there’s
    logic, there might be bugs, and where there might be bugs, you should write tests.
- For JavaScript libraries and, to some extent, TypeScript code, you can define your
    types independently of the runtime implementation. This means that the two can
    get out of sync, and you need to write tests to ensure that this doesn’t happen.

There are two main ways to test types: using the type system and using tooling out‐

side the type system. Either approach works, and both have their advantages. This

item will first look at some ineffective ways to test types, then talk about the pros and

cons of the two standard approaches.

Suppose you’ve written a type declaration for a map function provided by a utility

library (the popular Lodash library provides such a function, as do native arrays):

```
declare function map<U, V>(array: U[], fn: (u: U) => V): V[];
```
**240 | Chapter 6: Generics and Type-Level Programming**


How can you check that this type declaration results in the expected types? (Presuma‐

bly, there are separate tests for the implementation.) One common technique is to

write a test file that calls the function:

```
map(['2017', '2018', '2019'], v => Number(v));
```
This will do some blunt error checking: if your declaration of map only listed a single

parameter, this would catch the mistake. But does it feel like something is missing

here?

The equivalent of this style of test for runtime behavior might look something like

this:

```
test('square a number', () => {
square(1);
square(2);
});
```
Sure, this tests that the square function doesn’t throw an error. But it doesn’t check

the return value, so there’s no real test of the behavior. An incorrect implementation

of square would still pass this test.

This approach is common in testing type declaration files because it’s simple to copy/

paste existing unit tests for a library. And while it does provide some value, it would

be much better to actually check some types!

One way to do this is to assign the result to a variable with a declared type:

```
const lengths: number [] = map(['john', 'paul'], name => name.length);
```
This is exactly the sort of superfluous type declaration that Item 18 would encourage

you to remove. But here it plays an essential role: it provides some confidence that the

map declaration is at least doing something sensible with the types. And indeed, you

can find many type declarations in DefinitelyTyped that use exactly this approach for

testing.

There are a few problems with using assignment for testing, however.

One problem is that you have to create a named variable that is likely to be unused.

This adds boilerplate, and also means that you’ll have to disable any linter rules that

warn about unused variables.

The usual workaround is to define a helper:

```
function assertType<T>(x: T) {}
```
```
assertType< number []>(map(['john', 'paul'], name => name.length));
```
A second issue is that we’re checking assignability of the two types rather than equal‐

ity. Often this works as you’d expect. For example:

```
Item 55: Write Tests for Your Types | 241
```

```
const n = 12;
assertType< number >(n); // OK
```
If you inspect the n symbol in your editor, you’ll see that its type is actually 12 , a

numeric literal type. This is a subtype of number, and the assignability check passes,

just as you’d expect.

So far, so good. But things get murkier when you start checking the types of objects:

```
const beatles = ['john', 'paul', 'george', 'ringo'];
assertType<{name: string }[]>(
map(beatles, name => ({
name,
inYellowSubmarine: name === 'ringo'
}))
); // OK
```
The map call returns an array of {name: string, inYellowSubmarine: boolean}

objects. This is assignable to {name: string}[], so the code passes the type checker.

But what about the yellow submarine? In this case, we’d really prefer to check for type

equality.

Testing for assignability can lead to surprising behavior with function types, too:

```
const add = (a: number , b: number ) => a + b;
assertType<(a: number , b: number ) => number >(add); // OK
```
```
const double = (x: number ) => 2 * x;
assertType<(a: number , b: number ) => number >( double ); // OK!?
```
It’s surprising that the second assertion succeeds since the functions take different

numbers of parameters. But this is just how assignability works in TypeScript: a func‐

tion type is assignable to another function type that takes fewer parameters:

```
const g: (x: string ) => any = () => 12; // OK
```
This reflects the fact that it’s perfectly fine to call a JavaScript function with more

parameters than it’s declared to take. TypeScript chooses to model this behavior

rather than bar it, largely because it is pervasive in callbacks. The callback in the

Lodash map function, for example, takes up to three parameters:

```
map(array, (element, index, array) => { /* ... */ });
```
While all three are available if you need them, it’s very common to use only one or

sometimes two, as we have so far in this item. In fact, it’s quite rare to use all three. If

TypeScript disallowed this assignment, it would report errors in an enormous

amount of JavaScript code.

So what can you do? You could break apart the function type and test its pieces using

the built-in Parameters and ReturnType types:

**242 | Chapter 6: Generics and Type-Level Programming**


```
const double = (x: number ) => 2 * x;
declare let p: Parameters< typeof double >;
assertType<[ number , number ]>(p);
// ~ Argument of type '[number]' is not
// assignable to parameter of type [number, number]
declare let r: ReturnType< typeof double >;
assertType< number >(r); // OK
```
But if “this” isn’t complicated enough, there’s another issue: Lodash’s map sets the value

of this for its callback. TypeScript can model this behavior (see Item 69), so your

type declaration should do so. And you should test it. How can we do that?

Our tests of map so far have been a bit “black box” in style: we’ve run an array and

function through map and tested the type of the result, but we haven’t tested the

details of the intermediate steps. We can do so by filling out the callback function and

verifying the types of its parameters and this directly:

```
const beatles = ['john', 'paul', 'george', 'ringo'];
assertType< number []>(map(
beatles,
function (name, i, array) {
// ~~~ Argument of type '(name: any, i: any, array: any) => any' is
// not assignable to parameter of type '(u: string) => any'
assertType< string >(name);
assertType< number >(i);
assertType< string []>(array);
assertType< string []>( this );
// ~~~~ 'this' implicitly has type 'any'
return name.length;
}
));
```
This has surfaced a few issues with our declaration of map from earlier, namely that its

callback only takes one parameter and that it doesn’t set a type for this. Note the use

of a function expression instead of an arrow function so that we could test the type of

this.

Here is a declaration that passes the checks:

```
declare function map<U, V>(
array: U[],
fn: ( this : U[], u: U, i: number , array: U[]) => V
): V[];
```
There remains a final issue, however, and it is a major one. Here’s a complete type

declaration file for our module that will pass even the most stringent tests for map but

is worse than useless:

```
declare module 'your-amazing-module';
```
```
Item 55: Write Tests for Your Types | 243
```

This assigns an any type to the entire module. Your type assertions will all pass, but

you won’t have any type safety. What’s worse, every call to a function in this module

will quietly produce an any type, contagiously destroying type safety throughout your

code. Even with noImplicitAny, you can still get any types through type declarations

files.

One way to address this issue is by adding some “negative” tests: tests that are

expected to fail. TypeScript lets you do this via @ts-expect-error comments:

```
// @ts-expect-error only takes two parameters
map([1, 2, 3], x => x * x, 'third parameter');
```
This inverts the usual error checking process: now you’ll get a compiler error if there

isn’t a type error. This does give you some protection against any types, but be

warned: @ts-expect-error is a very blunt instrument. You can’t say exactly which

error you expect. For example, the previous snippet still passes with an any type

because there will be an implicit any error on the function parameter:

```
declare const map: any ;
map([1, 2, 3], x => x * x, 'third parameter');
// ~ Parameter 'x' implicitly has an 'any' type.
```
One workaround here is to split your code across multiple lines to reduce the scope

of the directive:

```
map(
[1, 2, 3],
x => x * x,
// @ts-expect-error only takes two parameters
'third parameter'
);
```
It would be better if we could adapt assertType to handle these pesky any types,

though. With some cleverness, you can detect an any type using a type alias. But

rather than add complexity to our testing code, let’s take this as a cue to pull in a test‐

ing library.

One of the more popular choices that works within the type system is expect-type.

You can use it on its own or via the vitest testing framework, which bundles it. Here’s

what it looks like:

```
import {expectTypeOf} from 'expect-type';
```
```
const beatles = ['john', 'paul', 'george', 'ringo'];
expectTypeOf(map(
beatles,
function (name, i, array) {
expectTypeOf(name).toEqualTypeOf< string >();
expectTypeOf(i).toEqualTypeOf< number >();
expectTypeOf(array).toEqualTypeOf< string []>();
```
**244 | Chapter 6: Generics and Type-Level Programming**


```
expectTypeOf( this ).toEqualTypeOf< string []>();
return name.length;
}
)).toEqualTypeOf< number []>();
```
As you’d hope, it’s able to catch any types, differing function types, and subtle differ‐

ences like readonly properties:

```
const anyVal: any = 1;
expectTypeOf(anyVal).toEqualTypeOf< number >();
// ~~~~~~
// Type 'number' does not satisfy the constraint 'never'.
```
```
const double = (x: number ) => 2 * x;
expectTypeOf( double ).toEqualTypeOf<(a: number , b: number ) => number >();
// ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
// Type ... does not satisfy '"Expected: function, Actual: never"'
```
```
interface ABReadOnly {
readonly a: string ;
b: number ;
}
declare let ab: {a: string , b: number };
expectTypeOf(ab).toEqualTypeOf<ABReadOnly>();
// ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
// Arguments for the rest parameter 'MISMATCH' were not provided.
expectTypeOf(ab).toEqualTypeOf<{a: string , b: number }>(); // OK
```
Testing types in this way offers a number of advantages:

- It doesn’t require any additional tooling. All type testing is done via tsc, which
    you’re using already.
- Since types are tested structurally, it won’t get tripped up by meaningless differ‐
    ences like 1|2 versus 2|1.
- TypeScript’s language service will help with refactoring. If you rename an inter‐
    face, for example, its name will also get updated in any type assertions.
- Your assertions will get formatted in the same way as your code if you’re using a
    formatting tool like prettier.

There are also a few downsides to this approach:

- The error message for mismatched types ('MISMATCH') doesn’t give much guid‐
    ance about what the mismatch is or where it occurs.
- Because it’s testing the structure of types, it cannot detect issues around how they
    display. As Item 56 will explain, you have some control over this and should care
    about it.

```
Item 55: Write Tests for Your Types | 245
```

That being said, this is a great way to test your types and it’s a vast improvement over

the hand-rolled attempts we saw earlier in this item.

Another approach in this vein was popularized by the Type Challenges repo. It looks

like this:

```
export type Equals<X, Y> =
(<T>() => T extends X? 1 : 2) extends
(<T>() => T extends Y? 1 : 2)? true : false ;
```
```
export type Expect<T extends true > = T;
```
```
const double = (x: number ) => 2 * x;
type Test1 = Expect<Equals< typeof double , (x: number ) => number >>;
type Test2 = Expect<Equals< typeof double , (x: string ) => number >>;
// ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
// Type 'false' does not satisfy the constraint 'true'.
```
Recall from Item 48 that function types are covariant with respect to their return

types. But the only way the first conditional type could reliably be assignable to the

second is if X is equal to Y. (Try plugging in a few concrete types for X, Y, and T to

convince yourself of this.) Rather than relying on type-level logic to test for equality,

this is the rare case where we can get TypeScript itself to compare types for equality.

While this is slightly more robust than expect-type, it has many of the same advan‐

tages and disadvantages. The error messages for failed tests aren’t particularly illumi‐

nating. And type equality is such a rare concept in TypeScript that the semantics are a

bit murky. Some parts of the type’s display matter, while others don’t:

```
type Test3 = Expect<Equals<1 | 2, 2 | 1>>; // good!
type Test4 = Expect<Equals<[a: 1, b: 2], [1, 2]>>; // maybe not so good
type Test5 = Expect<Equals<{x: 1} & {y: 2}, {x: 1, y: 2}>>; // surprising
// ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
// Type 'false' does not satisfy the constraint 'true'.
```
So much for testing types within the type system. What if you want to test types using

an external tool? Two common ones are dtslint and eslint-plugin-expect-type.

As the names suggest, these both operate as linters.

dtslint was built to test type declarations in the DefinitelyTyped repository. It oper‐

ates through specially formatted comments. Here’s how you might write the last test

for the map function using dtslint:

```
const beatles = ['john', 'paul', 'george', 'ringo'];
map(beatles, function (
name, // $ExpectType string
i, // $ExpectType number
array // $ExpectType string[]
) {
this // $ExpectType string[]
```
**246 | Chapter 6: Generics and Type-Level Programming**


```
return name.length;
}); // $ExpectType number[]
```
Rather than checking assignability, dtslint inspects the type of each symbol and

does a textual comparison. This matches how you’d manually test the type declara‐

tions in your editor: dtslint essentially automates this process. This approach does

have some drawbacks: despite being fundamentally the same type, number|string

and string|number are textually different. But so are string and any, despite being

assignable to each other, which is really the point.

eslint-plugin-expect-type works in a similar way, but as an ESLint plugin. This is

more convenient if you want to test your own TypeScript types, rather than type dec‐

larations on DefinitelyTyped. In addition to $ExpectType comments, it will check the

types in Twoslash-style comments:

```
const spiceGirls = ['scary', 'sporty', 'baby', 'ginger', 'posh'];
// ^? const spiceGirls: string[]
```
This should look familiar: it’s the same syntax used for code samples in this book! You

can also use Twoslash-style comments on the TypeScript playground (see Figure P-1

in the Preface to the Second Edition).

Testing types using an external tool has a number of strengths:

- It matches the way you interact with types in your editor. There’s no type-level
    fanciness required to do a character-by-character comparison of type displays.
- Since it tests the string representation of a type, it’s able to catch issues around
    how types display (Item 56).
- The ESLint plugin’s auto-fixer makes it easy to update tests.

There are some downsides, though:

- It requires setting up another tool (though it’s likely you’re already using ESLint).
- It can be too sensitive; e.g., saying that 1|2 and 2|1 are different types because
    they display differently.
- You miss out on type formatting / refactoring since the types are in comments.

Some tools take a hybrid approach. tsd, for example, is a type testing tool that oper‐

ates within the type system but also includes an external tool to provide the stricter

type checks that are hard to get otherwise.

Finally, there are some things you might like to test that neither tool can help you

with. For example, here’s a popular trick for providing autocomplete on a few values

while still allowing any string:

```
Item 55: Write Tests for Your Types | 247
```

```
type Game = 'wordle' | 'crossword' | ( string & {});
const spellingBee: Game = 'spelling bee';
let g: Game = '';
```
If you hit Ctrl-Space inside that last empty string, TypeScript will suggest “wordle” or

“crossword.” But it will still allow any string to be assigned to a Game. If you want to

write a test that this works as you expect, neither of the two approaches described in

this item will help (Figure 6-2).

Figure 6-2. TypeScript offers autocomplete for two values, but accepts all strings.

Testing type declarations is tricky business. You should test them. But be aware of the

pitfalls of some of the common techniques. Don’t roll your own type testing system. If

you’re writing type declarations on DefinitelyTyped, you should use dtslint because

that’s the standard tool in that setting. If you’re testing your own code, use a library

like vitest, expect-type, or tsd. If you want to write tests that are sensitive to the

way a type displays, not just its structure, use eslint-plugin-expect-type.

**Things to Remember**

- When testing types, be aware of the difference between equality and assignability,
    particularly for function types.
- For functions that use callbacks, test the inferred types of the callback parame‐
    ters. Don’t forget to test the type of this if it’s part of your API.
- Avoid writing your own type testing code. Use one of the standard tools instead.
- For code on DefinitelyTyped, use dtslint. For your own code, use vitest,
    expect-type, or the Type Challenges approach. If you want to test type display,
    use eslint-plugin-expect-type.

### Item 56: Pay Attention to How Types Display

Usually, we care about what types are and which values are assignable to them. But

when you’re using a TypeScript library, the way it chooses to display types can make a

big difference in your experience of using it. This means that, as a library author, you

need to pay attention to how your types display.

**248 | Chapter 6: Generics and Type-Level Programming**


For any type, there are many valid ways to display it. For example, union types typi‐

cally display their constituents in the order in which you listed them:

```
type T123 = '1' | '2' | '3';
// ^? type T123 = "1" | "2" | "3"
```
But if you happen to have introduced an overlapping union earlier, you might get a

different display:

```
type T21 = '2' | '1';
// ^? type T21 = "2" | "1"
```
```
type T123 = '1' | '2' | '3';
// ^? type T123 = "2" | "1" | "3"
```
Is it 1, 2, 3 or 2, 1, 3? They’re two equally valid representations of the exact same type.

In this case the legibility is about the same for both, but sometimes it can vary sub‐

stantially between multiple representations.

To see an example of an undesirable type display, let’s implement a PartiallyPartial

generic that makes a few of the properties of an object optional but not the others.

Here’s an implementation:

```
type PartiallyPartial<T, K extends keyof T> =
Partial<Pick<T, K>> & Omit<T, K>;
```
Here’s what it might look like in practice:

```
interface BlogComment {
commentId: number ;
title: string ;
content: string ;
}
```
```
type PartComment = PartiallyPartial<BlogComment, 'title'>;
// ^? type PartComment =
// Partial<Pick<BlogComment, "title">> &
// Omit<BlogComment, "title">
```
The generic type is implemented correctly, and this is a perfectly valid display of the

result of this instantiation. But it leaves a few things to be desired for a user inspecting

PartComment: what is the type of title? Is it nullable? And what other fields are there

behind that Omit? The whole thing feels implementation-y, as though it’s telling the

user more about how the generic type was defined than what the resulting type is.

We’d like to tell TypeScript to do a little more work to resolve those generic types.

There’s a widespread trick to do exactly that:

```
type Resolve<T> = T extends Function? T : {[K in keyof T]: T[K]};
```
```
Item 56: Pay Attention to How Types Display | 249
```

We’ll talk about how this works momentarily. But first, here’s how you use it:

```
type PartiallyPartial<T, K extends keyof T> =
Resolve<Partial<Pick<T, K>> & Omit<T, K>>;
```
```
type PartComment = PartiallyPartial<BlogComment, 'title'>;
// ^? type PartComment = {
// title?: string | undefined;
// commentId: number;
// content: string;
// }
```
By wrapping the generic type with Resolve, we’ve magically told TypeScript to flatten

out the display of all its properties. It’s much clearer what this type is now. Even bet‐

ter, all traces of the implementation are gone. The user of this type doesn’t need to

know that it’s been implemented using Partial, Pick, or Omit.

So how does Resolve work? If you ignore the conditional type, you’re left with an

expression that looks it should be the identity for object types:

```
type ObjIdentity<T> = {[K in keyof T]: T[K]};
```
And indeed, this does work to “resolve” some types. Because it’s a homomorphic

mapped type (see Item 15), it allows primitive types to pass through unmodified:

```
type S = ObjIdentity< string >;
// ^? type S = string
type N = ObjIdentity< number >;
// ^? type N = number
type U = ObjIdentity<'A' | 'B' | 'C'>;
// ^? type U = "A" | "B" | "C"
```
It’s not the identity for functions, however, which is why we need the conditional type

guarding Resolve:

```
type F = ObjIdentity<(a: number ) => boolean >;
// ^? type F = {}
```
This helper is ubiquitous in TypeScript code that uses lots of generic types. Resolve is

my choice of names, but you may also see it called Simplify, NOP, NOOP, or Merge

Insertions.

You can make a DeepResolve that recursively resolves object types, but this typically

isn’t a good idea because Resolve winds up being too aggressive on classes:

```
type D = Resolve<Date>;
// ^? type D = {
// toLocaleString: {
// (locales?: Intl.LocalesArgument,
// options?: Intl.DateTimeFormatOptions | undefined): string;
// (): string;
// (locales?: string | string[] | undefined,
// options?: Intl.DateTimeFormatOptions | undefined): string;
```
**250 | Chapter 6: Generics and Type-Level Programming**


##### // };

```
// ... 42 more ...;
// [Symbol.toPrimitive]: {
// ...;
// };
// }
```
The inlining has backfired here. Better to just let this type display as Date.

You can also use Resolve to inline keyof expressions if you feel that improves their

legibility:

```
interface Color { r: number ; g: number ; b: number ; a: number };
type Chan = keyof Color;
// ^? type Chan = keyof Color
type ChanInline = Resolve< keyof Color>;
// ^? type ChanInline = "r" | "g" | "b" | "a"
```
Sometimes there are particularly important cases for which you’d like to have types

display cleanly. For PartiallyPartial, this might be when the type parameter K is

never (in which case none of the fields are optional). Here’s how that case is handled

with our current definition:

```
type FullComment = PartiallyPartial<BlogComment, never >;
// ^? type FullComment = {
// title: string;
// commentId: number;
// content: string;
// }
```
This result is correct and it’s a valid way of displaying this type. But there’s a more

concise representation available: FullComment is just BlogComment. We can get a more

concise type by checking for this case:

```
type PartiallyPartial<T extends object, K extends keyof T> =
[K] extends [ never ]
? T // special case
: T extends unknown // extra conditional to preserve distribution over unions
? Resolve<Partial<Pick<T, K>> & Omit<T, K>>
: never ;
```
```
type FullComment = PartiallyPartial<BlogComment, never >;
// ^? type FullComment = BlogComment
```
See Item 53 for an explanation of why we’ve wrapped the condition in a tuple type

([K] instead of K) and added a T extends unknown clause. Adding this special case

does not change the behavior of PartiallyPartial at all, it just improves the way it

displays its result in one situation.

```
Item 56: Pay Attention to How Types Display | 251
```

```
6 For TypeScript, see https://oreil.ly/C5EzQ.
```
You may see some other techniques used to adjust type display, for example:

- Exclude<keyof T, never> to inline keyof expressions
- unknown & T or {} & T to inline object types

These can both be replaced by Resolve, which has the same effect and is less brittle.

When you change the display of your types, make sure you don’t sacrifice legibility in

one case for the sake of another. Since these manipulations are subtle and don’t affect

assignability, it’s easy for regressions to go unnoticed. New versions of TypeScript can

also affect how types display. For this reason, it’s important to have a system in place

for testing the display of types. Item 55 shows you how.

**Things to Remember**

- There are many valid ways to display the same type. Some are clearer than others.
- TypeScript gives you some tools to control how types display, notably the
    Resolve generic. Make judicious use of this to clarify type display and hide
    implementation details.
- Consider handling important special cases of generic types to improve type
    display.
- Write tests for your generic types and their display to avoid regressions.

### Item 57: Prefer Tail-Recursive Generic Types

The history of computing is filled with accidental programming languages. You add

some customizability to a system. Your users like it and ask for more. You add a few

more useful features. You keep giving your users more control. Soon enough, some‐

one points out that you’re Turing Complete!^6 Famous examples of this dynamic

include Microsoft Excel, the C preprocessor, C++ templates, and TypeScript generic

types.

These accidental programming languages are often purely functional because this

paradigm gives you tremendous control with a minimum of concepts. All you need is

function composition and some sort of branching. In the case of TypeScript’s type

system, function composition means instantiating a generic type. And you can get

branching either by looking up keys in an object type or by using a conditional type.

Purely functional languages typically implement looping via recursion. As we saw in

Item 54, this can be used to great effect to process string types.

**252 | Chapter 6: Generics and Type-Level Programming**


But while recursion is conceptually efficient, it comes with some real-world draw‐

backs because each recursive call requires a new entry on the stack.

To see how this can be a problem, let’s write a JavaScript function to sum all the num‐

bers in a list. One way is with recursion:

```
function sum(nums: readonly number []): number {
if (nums.length === 0) {
return 0;
}
return nums[0] + sum(nums.slice(1));
}
```
```
console.log(sum([0, 1, 2, 3, 4]));
```
As you’d expect, this prints:

```
10
```
This is not a very efficient way to sum a list of numbers. Each number in the list

entails another recursive call that uses stack space and will eventually overflow. For

me, using Node.js, this happens when the array has somewhere between 7,000 and

8,000 elements:

```
const arr = Array(7875).fill(1);
console.log(sum(arr));
```
```
return nums[0] + sum(nums.slice(1));
^
```
```
RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded
```
A version of sum implemented using a for-of loop would have no such limitation. So

are loops inherently better than recursion? Not so fast! Long ago, functional pro‐

grammers came up with a clever solution to this problem. If the last thing a function

does is call itself recursively and return that value, it can give up its space on the

stack: its work is done and it doesn’t need it any more. This is known as Tail Call

Optimization (TCO) and functions with this form are called tail recursive.

Here’s a tail-recursive version of sum that uses an accumulator:

```
function sum(nums: readonly number [], acc=0): number {
if (nums.length === 0) {
return acc;
}
return sum(nums.slice(1), nums[0] + acc);
}
```
```
Item 57: Prefer Tail-Recursive Generic Types | 253
```

```
7 Although ES2015 requires that JavaScript engines support Tail Call Optimization, at the time of this writing
only Safari does. This means that to see TCO in action, you need to use a runtime like bun that’s based on
JavaScriptCore (Safari) rather than one like Node that’s based on V8 (Chrome)
```
Running this quickly produces the correct result without a stack overflow:^7

```
$ bun sum-tail-rec.js
7875
```
The same concerns apply to recursive TypeScript type aliases. TypeScript limits the

number of recursive instantiations of a type alias to prevent infinite loops and slug‐

gishness in the type checker. But it supports Tail Call Optimization and gives tail-

recursive type aliases a much greater depth limit. Because they are more efficient and

more capable, you should make recursive type aliases tail recursive whenever

possible.

This is particularly relevant for generics that process string literal types one character

at a time. For example, here’s a generic type that converts a string literal type to the

union of the characters in the string:

```
type GetChars<S extends string > =
S extends `${ infer FirstChar}${ infer RestOfString}`
? FirstChar | GetChars<RestOfString>
: never ;
```
```
type ABC = GetChars<"abc">;
// ^? type ABC = "a" | "b" | "c"
```
This performs an operation (a union with FirstChar) after its recursive call, so it is

not tail recursive. For string literal types longer than about 50 characters, you’ll get an

overflow:

```
type Long = GetChars<"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWX">;
// ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
// Type instantiation is excessively deep and possibly infinite.
```
For a more realistic example of how this could cause a problem, let’s revisit objectTo

Camel from Item 54. That function took an object with snake_cased properties

({foo_bar: 0}) and returned an equivalent object with camelCased properties

({fooBar: 0}). We developed a ToCamel generic to convert the string literal type

"foo_bar" into "fooBar".

Now let’s go in the opposite direction and implement ToSnake. There’s no delimiter

(“_”) in this case, so we’ll process the string type character by character.

Here’s an implementation:

```
type ToSnake<T extends string > =
string extends T
```
**254 | Chapter 6: Generics and Type-Level Programming**


```
8 Try Googling “VirtualMachineDeviceRuntimeInfoVirtualEthernetCardRuntimeStateVmDirectPathGen2Inac‐
tiveReasonOther.”
```
```
? string // We want ToSnake<string> = string
: T extends `${ infer First}${ infer Rest}`
? (First extends Uppercase<First> // Is First a capital letter?
? `_${Lowercase<First>}${ToSnake<Rest>}` // e.g. "B" -> "_b"
: `${First}${ToSnake<Rest>}`)
: T;
```
```
type S = ToSnake<'fooBarBaz'>;
// ^? type S = "foo_bar_baz"
```
```
type Two = ToSnake<'className' | 'tagName'>;
// ^? type Two = "class_name" | "tag_name"
```
There are two recursive calls here, depending on whether the first character of the

string literal type is a capital letter. If so, we want to replace it with an underscore and

a lowercase letter and keep going. Otherwise we leave it as is and keep going. The

second example shows that it distributes over unions correctly (Item 53).

This type alias does work after the recursive call in each branch of the conditional

(string concatenation, lowercasing), so it’s not tail recursive. And, as you might expect

by now, it’s easy for it to overflow the stack:

```
type Long = ToSnake<'reallyDescriptiveNamePropThatsALittleTooLoquacious'>;
// ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
// Type instantiation is excessively deep and possibly infinite.
```
If you try to snake_case an object with a long key using this helper, your type will

blow up. While 50 characters might seem like enough for a property name, there are

many examples of properties that are much longer, particularly in the Java world.^8

We can lift the limitation for long string literal types and speed up type checking for

all instantiations by refactoring ToSnake to be tail recursive:

```
type ToSnake<T extends string , Acc extends string = ""> =
string extends T
? string // We want ToSnake<string> = string
: T extends `${ infer First}${ infer Rest}`
? ToSnake<
Rest,
First extends Uppercase<First>
? `${Acc}_${Lowercase<First>}`
: `${Acc}${First}`
>
: Acc;
```
```
type S = ToSnake<'fooBarBaz'>;
// ^? type S = "foo_bar_baz"
```
```
Item 57: Prefer Tail-Recursive Generic Types | 255
```

```
type Two = ToSnake<'className' | 'tagName'>;
// ^? type Two = "class_name" | "tag_name"
```
```
type Long = ToSnake<'reallyDescriptiveNamePropThatsALittleTooLoquacious'>;
// ^? type Long = "really_descriptive_name_prop_thats_a_little_too_loquacious"
```
As with the tail-recursive version of sum, we’ve added an accumulator to track the

work we’ve done so far. This allows us to shift the recursive instantiation into a tail

position and lift the limit. You’ll be able to snake_case whatever wordy property

names your Java coworkers throw at you!

**Things to Remember**

- Aim to make your recursive generic types tail recursive. They’re more efficient
    and have greater depth limits.
- Recursive type aliases can often be made tail recursive by rewriting them to use
    an accumulator.

### Item 58: Consider Codegen as an Alternative to Complex Types

```
Beware of the Turing tar-pit in which everything is possible but nothing of interest is easy.
—Alan Perlis
```
This chapter has explored programming at the type level in TypeScript. This means

implementing logic and functions that operate on types rather than values (Item 50).

Just like regular programs, we can write tests (Item 55) and think about their perfor‐

mance (Item 57). Especially with tools for working with template literal types (Item

54 ), type-level programs in TypeScript can do some truly impressive things.

TypeScript’s type system is Turing complete, so in theory you can represent any com‐

putation with it. As the quote at the start of this item warns, though, just because

something is possible does not mean it’s easy. Or wise.

Suppose your TypeScript program interacts with a database and includes some SQL:

```
async function getBooks(db: Database) {
const result = await db.query(
`SELECT title, author, year, publisher FROM books`
);
return result.rows;
}
```
With some cleverness, you may be able to use template literal types and conditional

types to parse that query in TypeScript’s type system. Combine this with a type repre‐

senting your database schema, and you may actually be able to infer the result type of

**256 | Chapter 6: Generics and Type-Level Programming**


that query from the query SQL itself. This is an impressive achievement, and you’ll

certainly get more precise types from it.

But what if your program also includes this query?

```
async function getLatestBookByAuthor(db: Database, publisher: string ) {
const result = await db.query(
`SELECT author, MAX(year) FROM books GROUP BY author WHERE publisher=$1`,
[publisher]
);
return result.rows;
}
```
Getting the right types for this query is substantially harder. Your SQL query parser

will need to understand GROUP BY clauses, MAX expressions, and know that the $1

placeholder means that you need to pass a second parameter with a single string in

an array. Even if you were able to build a parser for the first query, this one will likely

push your code into the “Turing tar-pit”, where everything is possible but nothing is

easy. You may also find it increasingly hard to be sure you’re following the advice of

Item 40 to prefer imprecise types to inaccurate types. With more complex programs,

it’s easier to make mistakes.

There’s an alternative that’s considerably simpler, though: code generation, or code‐

gen. Codegen is metaprogramming in the true sense: programs that operate on code

and generate other code. The beauty of codegen is that it lets you write your type

manipulations in any language you like. Yes, TypeScript’s type system is powerful and

capable, but it’s probably not your first choice for getting a job done. With codegen,

you can write your type manipulation code in ordinary TypeScript. You could also

use Python or Rust. Even a shell script might do the job.

For our SQL queries, one option is to use the PgTyped library. It finds appropriately-

tagged SQL queries in your TypeScript, examines them against a live database, and

writes out a type declaration file with the input and output types. Here’s how you’d

write your query in TypeScript using PgTyped:

```
// books-queries.ts
import { sql } from '@pgtyped/runtime';
const selectLatest = sql`
SELECT author, MAX(year)
FROM books
GROUP BY author
WHERE publisher=$publisher
`;
```
```
async function getLatestBookByAuthor(db: Database, publisher: string ) {
const result = await selectLatest.run({publisher}, db);
// ^? const result: any[]
return result;
}
```
```
Item 58: Consider Codegen as an Alternative to Complex Types | 257
```

Then you run the pgtyped command to do codegen:

```
$ npx pgtyped -c pgtyped.config.json
```
(pgtyped.config.json is a file that tells PgTyped how to connect to your database)

This results in a new file containing some types:

```
// books-queries.types.ts
/** Types generated for queries found in "books-queries.ts" */
```
```
/** 'selectLatest' parameters type */
export interface selectLatestParams {
publisher: string ;
}
```
```
/** 'selectLatest' return type */
export interface selectLatestResult {
author: string ;
year: number ;
}
```
```
/** 'selectLatest' query type */
export interface selectLatestQuery {
params: selectLatestParams;
result: selectLatestResult;
}
```
and some changes to books-queries.ts:

```
// books-queries.ts
import { sql } from '@pgtyped/runtime';
import { selectLatestQuery } from './books-queries.types';
export const selectLatestBookByAuthor = sql<selectLatestQuery>`
SELECT author, MAX(year)
FROM books
GROUP BY author
WHERE publisher=$publisher
`;
```
```
async function getLatestBookByAuthor(db: Database, publisher: string ) {
const result = await selectLatestBookByAuthor.run({publisher}, db);
// ^? const result: selectLatestResult[]
return result;
}
```
Our query is now correctly typed! PgTyped is certainly not a simple program, but it’s

written in TypeScript, uses standard database and testing libraries, and is surely less

painful to develop than any equivalently powerful tool written in TypeScript’s type

system would be.

**258 | Chapter 6: Generics and Type-Level Programming**


In addition to allowing you to work in a more conventional programming system, the

codegen approach gives you complete control over how the types display. The tricks

described in Item 56 won’t be needed with your generated types. You can make them

look exactly the way you like. Don’t like the snake_case type names? Just pipe them

through sed or your text processing tool of choice.

The resulting types are also likely to be much less taxing on the TypeScript compiler

and language services than your hand-rolled SQL parser.

The one notable cost of code generation is that it adds another build step that must be

run regularly to ensure that the generated code stays in sync. In the SQL case, that

means that the pgtyped command would need to be rerun whenever a query changes

or the database schema changes. The usual way to enforce this is by doing codegen on

your continuous integration (CI) system and running git diff to make sure nothing

has changed. You might also add this as a pre-push check.

Software engineering is a constant battle against complexity. Major programming

languages like TypeScript and the ecosystems around them have been built to give

you a fighting chance. Type-level TypeScript, while an impressive tool, is not the best

weapon in this battle. If you write some fancy type-level code in TypeScript and feel

like you’re wading through the Turing tar-pit, consider whether you could generate

types instead and write your code in a more conventional language.

Items 42 and 74 explore other ways in which codegen can be used to improve type

safety and reduce maintenance overhead.

**Things to Remember**

- While type-level TypeScript is an impressively powerful tool, it’s not always the
    best tool for the job.
- For complex type manipulations, consider generating code and types as an alter‐
    native to writing type-level code. Your code generation tool can be written in
    ordinary TypeScript or any other language.
- Run codegen and git diff on your continuous integration system to make sure
    generated code stays in sync.

**CHAPTER 7**

### TypeScript Recipes

As the TypeScript community has grown, developers have come up with more and

more tricks for solving specific problems. Some of these “recipes” leverage Type‐

Script’s type checker to catch new categories of mistakes, such as values getting out of

sync or nonexhaustive conditionals. Others are tricks for modeling patterns that

TypeScript struggles with on its own: iterating over objects, filtering null values from

Arrays, or modeling variadic functions.

By applying the recipes in this chapter, you’ll help TypeScript catch more real prob‐

lems with fewer false positives. If you enjoy these, you’ll find many more recipes in

Stefan Baumgartner’s TypeScript Cookbook.

### Item 59: Use Never Types to Perform Exhaustiveness Checking

Static type analysis is a great way to find places where you do something that you

shouldn’t. When you assign the wrong type of value, reference a nonexistent property,

or call a function with the wrong number of arguments, you’ll get a type error.

But there are also errors of omission: times when you should do something but you

don’t. While TypeScript won’t always catch these on its own, there’s a popular trick

that can be used to convert a missing case in a switch or if statement into a type

error. This is known as “exhaustiveness checking.” Let’s see how it works.

Suppose you’re building a drawing program, perhaps using the HTML <canvas> ele‐

ment. You might define the set of shapes you can draw using a tagged union:

##### 261


```
type Coord = [x: number , y: number ];
interface Box {
type : 'box';
topLeft: Coord;
size: Coord;
}
interface Circle {
type : 'circle';
center: Coord;
radius: number ;
}
type Shape = Box | Circle;
```
You can draw these using built-in canvas methods:

```
function drawShape(shape: Shape, context: CanvasRenderingContext2D) {
switch (shape. type ) {
case 'box':
context.rect(...shape.topLeft, ...shape.size);
break ;
case 'circle':
context.arc(...shape.center, shape.radius, 0, 2 * Math.PI);
break ;
}
}
```
So far, so good. Now you decide to add a third shape:

```
interface Line {
type : 'line';
start: Coord;
end: Coord;
}
type Shape = Box | Circle | Line;
```
There are no type errors, but this change has introduced a bug: drawShape will

silently ignore any line shapes. This is an error of omission. How can we get Type‐

Script to catch this kind of mistake?

If you look at the type of shape after an exhaustive switch statement, there’s a clue:

```
function processShape(shape: Shape) {
switch (shape. type ) {
case 'box': break ;
case 'circle': break ;
case 'line': break ;
default :
shape
// ^? (parameter) shape: never
}
}
```
**262 | Chapter 7: TypeScript Recipes**


Recall from Item 7 that the never type is a “bottom” type whose domain is the empty

set. When we’ve covered all the possible types of Shape, this is all that’s left. If we

missed a case, then the type would be something other than never:

```
function processShape(shape: Shape) {
switch (shape. type ) {
case 'box': break ;
case 'circle': break ;
// (forgot 'line')
default :
shape
// ^? (parameter) shape: Line
}
}
```
No value is assignable to the never type, and we can use this to turn an omission into

a type error:

```
function assertUnreachable(value: never ): never {
throw new Error(`Missed a case! ${value}`);
}
```
```
function drawShape(shape: Shape, context: CanvasRenderingContext2D) {
switch (shape. type ) {
case 'box':
context.rect(...shape.topLeft, ...shape.size);
break ;
case 'circle':
context.arc(...shape.center, shape.radius, 0, 2 * Math.PI);
break ;
default :
assertUnreachable(shape);
// ~~~~~
// ... type 'Line' is not assignable to parameter of type 'never'.
}
}
```
We’ll get into the details of assertUnreachable momentarily, but first let’s fix the

error by covering the missing case:

```
function drawShape(shape: Shape, context: CanvasRenderingContext2D) {
switch (shape. type ) {
case 'box':
context.rect(...shape.topLeft, ...shape.size);
break ;
case 'circle':
context.arc(...shape.center, shape.radius, 0, 2 * Math.PI);
break ;
case 'line':
context.moveTo(...shape.start);
context.lineTo(...shape.end);
break ;
```
```
Item 59: Use Never Types to Perform Exhaustiveness Checking | 263
```

```
default :
assertUnreachable(shape); // ok
}
}
```
It’s important to leave the assertUnreachable call in place, even if it is, as the name

suggests, unreachable. It protects you from future errors of omission should you

introduce additional shapes.

Why throw an exception in assertUnreachable? Isn’t this code unreachable? That

may be the case for well-typed TypeScript, but it’s always possible that drawShape will

be called from JavaScript, or with an any or other unsound type (Item 48). Throwing

an exception protects us from surprise values at runtime, not just during type

checking.

The exhaustiveness check was especially helpful for drawShape because it didn’t have

a return value. It was only run for side effects. If your function does return a value,

then annotating the return type gives you some protection against missing cases:

```
function getArea(shape: Shape): number {
// ~~~~~~ Function lacks ending return statement and
// return type does not include 'undefined'.
switch (shape. type ) {
case 'box':
const [width, height] = shape.size;
return width * height;
case 'circle':
return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;
}
}
```
If we’d omitted the return type annotation, TypeScript would have inferred it as

number | undefined rather than producing an error. It’s likely that this would have

produced errors elsewhere in your code, where you call getArea, but it’s better to get

errors close to where the mistake was made. As Item 18 explained, it’s a good idea to

add a return type annotation to any function with multiple returns.

(You’ll only get this error when strictNullChecks is set, since otherwise, undefined

is part of the number type. This is a great reason to use strictNullChecks!)

As the error says, if undefined is a legitimate return value, then this check won’t pro‐

tect you. Even when a function returns a value, it can be a good idea to do exhaustive‐

ness checking.

That’s why we added never as the return type for assertUnreachable earlier. Since

never is assignable to all other types, you can safely return it, regardless of the return

type of the function:

```
function getArea(shape: Shape): number {
switch (shape. type ) {
```
**264 | Chapter 7: TypeScript Recipes**


```
case 'box':
const [width, height] = shape.size;
return width * height;
case 'circle':
return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;
case 'line':
return 0;
default :
return assertUnreachable(shape); // ok
}
}
```
The assertUnreachable pattern is common in TypeScript code and you may run

into other variations on it, either using a direct assignment to never:

```
function processShape(shape: Shape) {
switch (shape. type ) {
case 'box': break ;
case 'circle': break ;
default :
const exhaustiveCheck: never = shape;
// ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Type 'Line' is not assignable to type 'never'.
throw new Error(`Missed a case: ${exhaustiveCheck}`);
}
}
```
or using the satisfies operator:

```
function processShape(shape: Shape) {
switch (shape. type ) {
case 'box': break ;
case 'circle': break ;
default :
shape satisfies never
// ~~~~~~~~~ Type 'Line' does not satisfy the expected type 'never'.
throw new Error(`Missed a case: ${shape}`);
}
}
```
All of these patterns work in the same way. Use whichever one you like best.

With some cleverness, the same trick can be extended to make sure you handle all

pairs of two types, i.e., the cross-product. For example, say you write some code to

play “rock, paper, scissors”:

```
type Play = 'rock' | 'paper' | 'scissors';
```
```
function shoot(a: Play, b: Play) {
if (a === b) {
console.log('draw');
} else if (
(a === 'rock' && b === 'scissors') ||
(a === 'paper' && b === 'rock')
```
```
Item 59: Use Never Types to Perform Exhaustiveness Checking | 265
```

##### ) {

```
console.log('A wins');
} else {
console.log('B wins');
}
}
```
Unfortunately, we’ve missed a case. If A plays scissors on B’s paper, then, much to

player A’s surprise, this function will report that B has won. We can use a template

literal type (Item 54) and exhaustiveness checking to force ourselves to cover every

possible case explicitly:

```
function shoot(a: Play, b: Play) {
const pair = `${a},${b}` as `${Play},${Play}`; // or: as const
// ^? const pair: "rock,rock" | "rock,paper" | "rock,scissors" |
// "paper,rock" | "paper,paper" | "paper,scissors" |
// "scissors,rock" | "scissors,paper" | "scissors,scissors"
switch (pair) {
case 'rock,rock':
case 'paper,paper':
case 'scissors,scissors':
console.log('draw');
break ;
case 'rock,scissors':
case 'paper,rock':
console.log('A wins');
break ;
case 'rock,paper':
case 'paper,scissors':
case 'scissors,rock':
console.log('B wins');
break ;
default :
assertUnreachable(pair);
// ~~~~ Argument of type "scissors,paper" is not
// assignable to parameter of type 'never'.
}
}
```
By default, `${a},${b}` would have a type of string. `${Play},${Play}` is a sub‐

type of string consisting of the nine possible pairs of plays separated by a comma.

We can apply the usual exhaustiveness checking trick to make sure we’ve covered all

nine. In this case, we missed one and it resulted in a type error. The error even

included the combination we missed! As before, add the missing case and leave the

assertion in place in case you ever add an additional possible play.

While it comes up less frequently than straightforward exhaustiveness checking, this

technique is occasionally helpful for modeling transitions between states.

**266 | Chapter 7: TypeScript Recipes**


The typescript-eslint rule switch-exhaustiveness-check can also be used for

exhaustiveness checking. Whereas assertUnreachable is opt-in, the linter rule is

opt-out. If you enable it, you may find that some of your switch statements were not

intended to be exhaustive, or that they are exhaustive for reasons that are hard to cap‐

ture in the type system. And you can use assertUnreachable in other situations that

are intended to be exhaustive, such as if statements. But you may find some bugs,

too, so the linter rule is worth a try!

Errors of omission are just as important as errors of commission. Use never types

and the assertUnreachable trick to let TypeScript help you avoid them.

**Things to Remember**

- Use an assignment to the never type to ensure that all possible values of a type
    are handled (an “exhaustiveness check”).
- Add a return type annotation to functions that return from multiple branches.
    You may still want an explicit exhaustiveness check, however.
- Consider using template literal types to ensure that every combination of two or
    more types is handled.

### Item 60: Know How to Iterate Over Objects

This code runs fine, and yet TypeScript flags an error in it. Why?

```
const obj = {
one: 'uno',
two: 'dos',
three: 'tres',
};
for ( const k in obj) {
const v = obj[k];
// ~~~~~~ Element implicitly has an 'any' type
// because type ... has no index signature
}
```
Inspecting the obj and k symbols gives a clue:

```
const obj = { one: 'uno', two: 'dos', three: 'tres' };
// ^? const obj: {
// one: string;
// two: string;
// three: string;
// }
for ( const k in obj) {
// ^? const k: string
// ...

```

```
1 Symbols can also be object keys but they are not enumerable.
```
The type of k is string, but you’re trying to index into an object whose type only has

three specific keys: 'one', 'two', and 'three'. There are strings other than these

three, so this has to fail.

Using a type assertion to get a narrower type for k fixes the issue:

```
for ( const kStr in obj) {
const k = kStr as keyof typeof obj;
// ^? const k: "one" | "two" | "three"
const v = obj[k]; // OK
}
```
So the real question is: why is the type of k in the first example inferred as string

rather than "one" | "two" | "three"?

To understand, let’s look at a slightly different example:

```
interface ABC {
a: string ;
b: string ;
c: number ;
}
```
```
function foo(abc: ABC) {
for ( const k in abc) {
// ^? const k: string
const v = abc[k];
// ~~~~~~ Element implicitly has an 'any' type
// because type 'ABC' has no index signature
}
}
```
It’s the same error as before. And you can “fix” it using the same sort of type assertion

(k as keyof ABC). But in this case TypeScript is right to complain. Here’s why:

```
const x = {a: 'a', b: 'b', c: 2, d: new Date()};
foo(x); // OK
```
The function foo can be called with any value assignable to ABC, not just a value with

'a', 'b', and 'c' properties. It’s entirely possible that the value will have other prop‐

erties, too (see Item 4 for a refresher on why). To allow for this, TypeScript gives k the

only type it can be confident of, namely, string.^1

Using a type assertion to keyof ABC would have another downside here:

```
function foo(abc: ABC) {
for ( const kStr in abc) {
let k = kStr as keyof ABC;
// ^? let k: keyof ABC (equivalent to "a" | "b" | "c")
```
**268 | Chapter 7: TypeScript Recipes**


```
2 The typings for utility functions like Lodash’s _.forEach and may provide more precise types for k and v, but
these are unsound for the reasons mentioned in this item.
```
```
const v = abc[k];
// ^? const v: string | number
}
}
```
If "a" | "b" | "c" is too narrow for k, then string | number is certainly too nar‐

row for v. In the preceding example, one of the values is a Date, but it could be any‐

thing. This could lead to chaos at runtime. As Item 9 explained, type assertions

should always make you nervous because TypeScript might be on to something. (Sur‐

prisingly, TypeScript will let you declare let k: keyof ABC above this for-in loop

and use k as the iterator, but this is no safer than a type assertion and is less explicit.)

So what if you just want to iterate over the object’s keys and values without type

errors? Object.entries lets you iterate over both simultaneously:

```
function foo(abc: ABC) {
for ( const [k, v] of Object.entries(abc)) {
// ^? const k: string
console.log(v);
// ^? const v: any
}
}
```
While these types may be hard to work with, they are at least honest!^2

Another reason that TypeScript infers string in for-in loops is prototype pollution.

This is a security issue where properties defined on Object.prototype are inherited

by all other objects. These inherited properties will be enumerated by a for-in loop,

so string is a safer choice. (Object.entries excludes inherited properties.)

A safe way to get more precise types is to explicitly list the keys you’re interested in:

```
function foo(abc: ABC) {
const keys = ['a', 'b', 'c'] as const ;
for ( const k of keys) {
// ^? const k: "a" | "b" | "c"
const v = abc[k];
// ^? const v: string | number
}
}
```
If your intention is to cover all the keys in ABC, you’ll need some way to keep the keys

array in sync with the type.

```
Item 60: Know How to Iterate Over Objects | 269
```

While iterating over objects comes with many hazards, iterating over a Map does not:

```
const m = new Map([
// ^? const m: Map<string, string>
['one', 'uno'],
['two', 'dos'],
['three', 'tres'],
]);
for ( const [k, v] of m.entries()) {
// ^? const k: string
console.log(v);
// ^? const v: string
}
```
Maps are easier to iterate over because they don’t have the same structural behavior as

objects: you’ll never put a number value in a Map<string, string> without using a

type assertion or going through an any type. But they can be less convenient to work

with if your data is coming via JSON or from another API that’s already designed to

use objects. Item 16 has an example of how replacing an object type with a Map can

improve the type safety of your code.

If you want to iterate over the keys and values in an immutable object, you can use an

explicit type assertion on the key in a for-in loop. To safely iterate over an object that

could have additional properties, use Object.entries. It’s always safe, though the key

and value types are more difficult to work with. And consider whether a Map might be

an appropriate alternative.

**Things to Remember**

- Be aware that any objects your function receives as parameters might have addi‐
    tional keys.
- Use Object.entries to iterate over the keys and values of any object.
- Use a for-in loop with an explicit type assertion to iterate objects when you
    know exactly what the keys will be.
- Consider Map as an alternative to objects since it’s easier to iterate over.

### Item 61: Use Record Types to Keep Values in Sync

Suppose you’re writing a UI component for drawing scatter plots. It has a few differ‐

ent types of properties that control its display and behavior:

```
interface ScatterProps {
// The data
xs: number [];
ys: number [];
```
**270 | Chapter 7: TypeScript Recipes**


```
// Display
xRange: [ number , number ];
yRange: [ number , number ];
color: string ;
```
```
// Events
onClick?: (x: number , y: number , index: number ) => void ;
}
```
To avoid unnecessary work, you’d like to redraw the chart only when you need to.

Changing data or display properties will require a redraw, but changing the event

handler will not.

Here’s one way you might implement this optimization:

```
function shouldUpdate(
oldProps: ScatterProps,
newProps: ScatterProps
) {
for ( const kStr in oldProps) {
const k = kStr as keyof ScatterProps;
if (oldProps[k] !== newProps[k]) {
if (k !== 'onClick') return true ;
}
}
return false ;
}
```
(See Item 60 for an explanation of the keyof assertion in this loop. This assertion is

safe because we don’t care about the value types, only whether they are equal.)

What happens when you or a coworker add a new property? The shouldUpdate func‐

tion will redraw the chart whenever it changes. You might call this the conservative or

“fail open” approach. The upside is that the chart will always look right. The down‐

side is that it might be drawn too often.

A “fail closed” approach might look like this:

```
function shouldUpdate(
oldProps: ScatterProps,
newProps: ScatterProps
) {
return (
oldProps.xs !== newProps.xs ||
oldProps.ys !== newProps.ys ||
oldProps.xRange !== newProps.xRange ||
oldProps.yRange !== newProps.yRange ||
oldProps.color !== newProps.color
// (no check for onClick)
);
}
```
```
Item 61: Use Record Types to Keep Values in Sync | 271
```

With this approach there won’t be any unnecessary redraws, but there might be some

necessary draws that get dropped. An important principle in optimization is to “first,

do no harm.” We shouldn’t sacrifice correct behavior for the sake of performance.

Neither approach is ideal. What you’d really like is to force your coworker or future

self to make a decision when adding the new property. You might try adding a

comment:

```
interface ScatterProps {
xs: number [];
ys: number [];
// ...
onClick?: (x: number , y: number , index: number ) => void ;
```
```
// Note: if you add a property here, update shouldUpdate!
}
```
But do you really expect this to work? It would be better if the type checker could

enforce this for you.

If you set it up the right way, it can. The key is to use a Record type with the right set

of keys:

```
const REQUIRES_UPDATE: Record< keyof ScatterProps, boolean > = {
xs: true ,
ys: true ,
xRange: true ,
yRange: true ,
color: true ,
onClick: false ,
};
```
```
function shouldUpdate(
oldProps: ScatterProps,
newProps: ScatterProps
) {
for ( const kStr in oldProps) {
const k = kStr as keyof ScatterProps;
if (oldProps[k] !== newProps[k] && REQUIRES_UPDATE[k]) {
return true ;
}
}
return false ;
}
```
The keyof ScatterProps annotation tells the type checker that REQUIRES_UPDATE

should have all the same properties as ScatterProps. Critically, these are all required

properties.

Now if in the future you add a new property to ScatterProps:

**272 | Chapter 7: TypeScript Recipes**


```
interface ScatterProps {
// ...
onDoubleClick?: () => void ;
}
```
then this will produce an error in the definition of REQUIRES_UPDATE:

```
const REQUIRES_UPDATE: Record< keyof ScatterProps, boolean > = {
// ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Property 'onDoubleClick' is missing in type ...
// ...
};
```
This will certainly force the issue! Deleting or renaming a property will cause a simi‐

lar error. This is excess property checking (Item 11) at work, and it lets us enforce

that the object has exactly the set of properties we want, no more, no less. TypeScript

has given us a third choice in the classic fail open/fail closed dilemma, namely “just

fail.”

It’s important that we used an object with boolean values here. Had we used an array:

```
const PROPS_REQUIRING_UPDATE: ( keyof ScatterProps)[] = [
'xs',
'ys',
// ...
];
```
then we would have been forced into the same fail open/fail closed choice.

Records and mapped types are ideal if you want one object to have exactly the same

properties as another. Here we used it to avoid the classic fail open/fail closed

dilemma, but there are many other applications, for example, requiring that every

property in your application’s state have a corresponding URL parameter.

**Things to Remember**

- Recognize the fail open versus fail closed dilemma.
- Use Record types to keep related values and types synchronized.
- Consider using Record types to force choices when adding new properties to an
    interface.

### Item 62: Use Rest Parameters and Tuple Types to Model Variadic Functions

Sometimes you’d like to have a function take a different number of arguments,

depending on a TypeScript type.

To see how this might happen, imagine that you have an interface that describes the

query parameters that different routes in a web app can accept:

```
Item 62: Use Rest Parameters and Tuple Types to Model Variadic Functions | 273
```

```
interface RouteQueryParams {
'/': null ,
'/search': { query: string ; language?: string ; }
// ...
}
```
This says that the root page (/) does not take any query parameters, whereas

the /search page takes a query param and an optional language param.

You can define a function to construct a URL for a route:

```
function buildURL(route: keyof RouteQueryParams, params?: any ) {
return route + (params? `?${ new URLSearchParams(params)}` : '');
}
```
```
console.log(buildURL('/search', {query: 'do a barrel roll', language: 'en'}))
console.log(buildURL('/'))
```
This builds the URLs you’d expect:

```
/search?query=do+a+barrel+roll&language=en
/
```
Unfortunately, it’s not very safe thanks to that any on the second parameter. You’re

free to construct a URL for any route with whatever search parameters you like:

```
buildURL('/', {query: 'recursion'}); // should be an error (no params for root)
buildURL('/search'); // should be an error (missing params)
```
Here’s a safer version:

```
function buildURL<Path extends keyof RouteQueryParams>(
route: Path,
params: RouteQueryParams[Path]
) {
return route + (params? `?${ new URLSearchParams(params)}` : '');
}
```
We’ve made the function generic in the route, which can usually be inferred, and

made the parameter type depend on this route.

This new type signature works perfectly for the /search route:

```
buildURL('/search', {query: 'do a barrel roll'})
buildURL('/search', {query: 'do a barrel roll', language: 'en'})
buildURL('/search', {})
// ~~ Property 'query' is missing in type '{}'
```
For the root page, however, you need to pass an additional null parameter:

```
buildURL('/', {query: 'recursion'}); // error, good!
// ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Argument of type '{ query: string; }' is
// not assignable to parameter of type 'null'
buildURL('/', null ); // ok
```
**274 | Chapter 7: TypeScript Recipes**


```
buildURL('/'); // we'd like this to be allowed
// ~~~~~ Expected 2 arguments, but got 1.
```
Writing an extra null isn’t the end of the world, of course, but it is a nuisance and the

old API with its optional parameter looked nicer. We could make the second parame‐

ter optional with the new version, but this should only be allowed when the route

doesn’t take any search parameters. In other words, we want the function to take a

variable number of arguments, depending on an inferred type.

The trick to doing this is to use a conditional type (Item 52) and rest parameters:

```
function buildURL<Path extends keyof RouteQueryParams>(
route: Path,
...args: (
RouteQueryParams[Path] extends null
? []
: [params: RouteQueryParams[Path]]
)
) {
const params = args? args[0] : null ;
return route + (params? `?${ new URLSearchParams(params)}` : '');
}
```
If the query parameter type extends null, then this looks like: (route:

Path, ...args: []), which is a one-parameter function. If it doesn’t, then it looks

like (route: Path, ...args: [params: ...]), which is a two-parameter function.

This works exactly as you’d hope:

```
buildURL('/search', {query: 'do a barrel roll'})
buildURL('/search', {query: 'do a barrel roll', language: 'en'})
buildURL('/search', {})
// ~~ Property 'query' is missing in type '{}' ...
```
```
buildURL('/', {query: 'recursion'});
// ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Expected 1 arguments, but got 2.
buildURL('/', null );
// ~~~~ Expected 1 arguments, but got 2.
buildURL('/'); // ok
```
When you inspect the call sites, it really looks like there are two different functions,

depending on the route. The rest parameter is an implementation detail that’s hidden

from the user. TypeScript has even picked up the name of the second parameter

(params) from the label on the tuple element:

```
buildURL('/');
// ^? function buildURL<"/">(route: "/"): string
buildURL('/search', {query: 'do a barrel roll'})
// ^? function buildURL<"/search">(
// route: "/search", params: { query: string; language?: string; }
// ): string
```
```
Item 62: Use Rest Parameters and Tuple Types to Model Variadic Functions | 275
```

If you fail to include this label, your users will see a more generic parameter name like

args_0.

This is the most general technique for modeling variadic functions. You could also

use overload signatures to achieve a similar effect, but this would result in code dupli‐

cation and, as Item 52 explained, conditional types handle unions more naturally

than overloads.

Sometimes the number or type of parameters to a function depends on a TypeScript

type. When this happens, you can model it using rest parameters with a tuple type.

**Things to Remember**

- Use rest parameters and tuple types to model functions whose signature depends
    on the type of an argument.
- Use conditional types to model relationships between the type of one parameter
    and the number and type of the remaining parameters.
- Remember to label the elements of your tuple types to get meaningful parameter
    names at call sites.

### Item 63: Use Optional Never Properties to Model Exclusive Or

In ordinary speech, “or” means “exclusive or.” Only programmers and logicians use

an inclusive or.

In TypeScript, it’s easy to get mixed up between these two:

```
interface ThingOne {
shirtColor: string ;
}
interface ThingTwo {
hairColor: string ;
}
type Thing = ThingOne | ThingTwo;
```
We usually read the last line as “type Thing is a ThingOne or ThingTwo.” But just like

JavaScript’s runtime or (||), TypeScript’s type-level or (|) is an inclusive or. There’s no

reason a thing can’t be both a ThingOne and a ThingTwo:

```
const bothThings = {
shirtColor: 'red',
hairColor: 'blue',
};
const thing1: ThingOne = bothThings; // ok
const thing2: ThingTwo = bothThings; // ok
```
**276 | Chapter 7: TypeScript Recipes**


Why does this work? It’s because TypeScript has a structural type system (Item 4).

Both the ThingOne and ThingTwo types allow additional properties that aren’t

declared in their interface, though, as Item 11 explains, this is sometimes obscured by

excess property checking.

So what if you really do want an exclusive or? What if you want to keep your

ThingOnes and ThingTwos separate? How can you model that?

The standard trick is to use an optional _never_ type in your interface to disallow a

property:

```
interface OnlyThingOne {
shirtColor: string ;
hairColor?: never ;
}
interface OnlyThingTwo {
hairColor: string ;
shirtColor?: never ;
}
type ExclusiveThing = OnlyThingOne | OnlyThingTwo;
```
Now none of the assignments from before pass the type checker:

```
const thing1: OnlyThingOne = bothThings;
// ~~~~~~ Types of property 'hairColor' are incompatible.
const thing2: OnlyThingTwo = bothThings;
// ~~~~~~ Types of property 'shirtColor' are incompatible.
const allThings: ExclusiveThing = {
// ~~~~~~~~~ Types of property 'hairColor' are incompatible.
shirtColor: 'red',
hairColor: 'blue',
};
```
This works because no value is assignable to a never type. But because the property is

optional, there’s exactly one way out: not having that property.

This isn’t just useful for unions. Recall from Item 4 that structural typing isn’t a good

model for two- and three-dimensional vectors. You can use an optional never to

directly disallow a z property on a 2D vector:

```
interface Vector2D {
x: number ;
y: number ;
z?: never ;
}
```
With this type, you’ll get an error if you accidentally pass a three-dimensional vector

to a function like norm that expects a two-dimensional vector:

```
Item 63: Use Optional Never Properties to Model Exclusive Or | 277
```

```
function norm(v: Vector2D) {
return Math.sqrt(v.x ** 2 + v.y ** 2);
}
const v = {x: 3, y: 4, z: 5};
const d = norm(v);
// ~ Types of property 'z' are incompatible.
```
This wouldn’t be an error without the z?: never because the call is structurally valid,

even though it’s semantically incorrect. We’ll look at another approach to fixing the

Vector2D problem, brands, in Item 64.

You can also use a tagged union (Item 34) to achieve an exclusive or:

```
interface ThingOneTag {
type : 'one';
shirtColor: string ;
}
interface ThingTwoTag {
type : 'two';
hairColor: string ;
}
type Thing = ThingOneTag | ThingTwoTag;
```
A string can’t be both 'one' and 'two', so there’s no overlap between these types.

This means there’s no distinction between inclusive and exclusive or. This is one of

many great reasons to use tagged unions when you can.

Rather than adding optional never properties by hand, it’s possible to define a generic

exclusive or (XOR) helper:

```
type XOR<T1, T2> =
(T1 & {[k in Exclude< keyof T2, keyof T1>]?: never }) |
(T2 & {[k in Exclude< keyof T1, keyof T2>]?: never });
```
You can use this to construct ExclusiveThing directly from the interfaces at the

start of this item:

```
type ExclusiveThing = XOR<ThingOne, ThingTwo>;
const allThings: ExclusiveThing = {
// ~~~~~~~~~ Types of property 'hairColor' are incompatible.
shirtColor: 'red',
hairColor: 'blue',
};
```
While tagged unions are a more common way to create exclusive types in TypeScript,

the optional never trick can be helpful in situations where you either can’t or don’t

want to add an explicit tag.

**278 | Chapter 7: TypeScript Recipes**


**Things to Remember**

- In TypeScript, “or” is “inclusive or”: A | B means either A, B, or both.
- Consider the “both” possibility in your code, and either handle it or disallow it.
- Use tagged unions to model exclusive or where it’s convenient. Consider using
    optional never properties where it isn’t.

### Item 64: Consider Brands for Nominal Typing

Item 4 discussed structural typing and how it can sometimes lead to surprising

results:

```
interface Vector2D {
x: number ;
y: number ;
}
function calculateNorm(p: Vector2D) {
return Math.sqrt(p.x ** 2 + p.y ** 2);
}
```
```
calculateNorm({x: 3, y: 4}); // OK, result is 5
const vec3D = {x: 3, y: 4, z: 1};
calculateNorm(vec3D); // OK! result is also 5
```
What if you’d like calculateNorm to reject 3D vectors? This goes against the struc‐

tural typing model of TypeScript but is certainly more mathematically correct.

Item 63 showed how you can specifically prevent a z field using an optional never

property. This is a purely type-level fix. It doesn’t require you to change the values at

runtime.

You can also prevent types from being assignable to one another by adding a “tag” to

the value at runtime:

```
interface Vector2D {
type : '2d';
x: number ;
y: number ;
}
```
Here the type property serves as the “tag.” This pattern is particularly common with

union types. Item 34 explored “tagged unions” in more detail and they are certainly

one way to mitigate this problem. They do have a few downsides, however. They add

runtime overhead, changing what was previously a very simple type with only

numeric properties into one with a mix of strings and numbers. Moreover, you can

only add an explicit tag like this to object types.

```
Item 64: Consider Brands for Nominal Typing | 279
```

Interestingly, you can get many of the same benefits as explicit tags while operating

only in the type system. In this context, tags are typically known as “brands” (think

cows, not Coca-Cola). This types-only approach removes runtime overhead and also

lets you brand built-in types like string or number where you can’t attach additional

properties. This is known as nominal typing, as opposed to TypeScript’s usual struc‐

tural typing. With nominal typing, a value is a Vector2D because you say it is, not

because it has the right shape.

Let’s see how this works using filesystem paths. What if you have a function that

operates on the filesystem and requires an absolute (as opposed to a relative) path?

This is easy to check at runtime (does the path start with “/”?), but not so easy in the

type system.

Here’s an approach with brands:

```
type AbsolutePath = string & {_brand: 'abs'};
function listAbsolutePath(path: AbsolutePath) {
// ...
}
function isAbsolutePath(path: string ): path is AbsolutePath {
return path.startsWith('/');
}
```
You can’t construct an object that is a string and has a _brand property. This is

purely a game with the type system. (If you think you can assign properties to a

string, Item 10 will explain why you’re mistaken.)

If you have a string path that could be either absolute or relative, you can check

using the type guard, which will refine its type:

```
function f(path: string ) {
if (isAbsolutePath(path)) {
listAbsolutePath(path);
}
listAbsolutePath(path);
// ~~~~ Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to
// parameter of type 'AbsolutePath'
}
```
This is helpful documentation about which functions expect absolute or relative

paths, and which type of path each variable holds. It is not an ironclad guarantee:

path as AbsolutePath will succeed for any string. But if you avoid these sorts of

assertions, then the only way to get an AbsolutePath is to be given one or to check,

which is exactly what you want.

You can also brand number types—for example, to attach units:

```
type Meters = number & {_brand: 'meters'};
type Seconds = number & {_brand: 'seconds'};
```
**280 | Chapter 7: TypeScript Recipes**


```
const meters = (m: number ) => m as Meters;
const seconds = (s: number ) => s as Seconds;
```
```
const oneKm = meters(1000);
// ^? const oneKm: Meters
const oneMin = seconds(60);
// ^? const oneMin: Seconds
```
This can be awkward in practice, however, since arithmetic operations make the

numbers forget their brands:

```
const tenKm = oneKm * 10;
// ^? const tenKm: number
const v = oneKm / oneMin;
// ^? const v: number
```
If your code involves lots of numbers with mixed units, though, this may still be an

attractive approach to documenting the expected types of numeric parameters.

There are other techniques for branding types. You may encounter code that uses pri‐

vate fields to brand classes or an intersection with TypeScript string-based enums,

which are nominally typed (Item 72).

Another common technique is to use a unique symbol type:

```
declare const brand: unique symbol;
export type Meters = number & {[brand]: 'meters'};
```
The advantage of this technique is that, since the brand symbol isn’t exported, users

will have to use a type assertion or helper function to get a value with a Meters type.

They can’t use the brand directly or create another type that’s compatible with it.

Regardless of how you construct them, brands can be used to model many properties

that cannot be expressed within the type system. For example, using binary search to

find an element in a list:

```
function binarySearch<T>(xs: T[], x: T): boolean {
let low = 0, high = xs.length - 1;
while (high >= low) {
const mid = low + Math.floor((high - low) / 2);
const v = xs[mid];
if (v === x) return true ;
[low, high] = x > v? [mid + 1, high] : [low, mid - 1];
}
return false ;
}
```
This works if the list is sorted, but will result in false negatives if it is not. You can’t

represent a sorted list in TypeScript’s type system. But you can create a brand:

```
type SortedList<T> = T[] & {_brand: 'sorted'};
```
```
function isSorted<T>(xs: T[]): xs is SortedList<T> {
```
```
Item 64: Consider Brands for Nominal Typing | 281
```

```
for ( let i = 0; i < xs.length - 1; i++) {
if (xs[i] > xs[i + 1]) {
return false ;
}
}
return true ;
}
```
```
function binarySearch<T>(xs: SortedList<T>, x: T): boolean {
// ...
}
```
To call this version of binarySearch, you either need to be given a SortedList (i.e.,

have proof that the list is sorted) or prove that it’s sorted yourself using isSorted. The

linear scan isn’t great, but at least you’ll be safe!

This is a helpful perspective to have on the type checker in general. To call a method

on an object, for instance, you either need to be given a non-null object or prove that

it’s non-null yourself with a conditional. This is analogous to the two ways of getting

a SortedList: you can either be given one, or prove that the list is sorted yourself.

**Things to Remember**

- With nominal typing, a value has a type because you say it has a type, not because
    it has the same shape as that type.
- Consider attaching brands to distinguish primitive and object types that are
    semantically distinct but structurally identical.
- Be familiar with the various techniques for branding: properties on object types,
    string-based enums, private fields, and unique symbols.

**282 | Chapter 7: TypeScript Recipes**


**CHAPTER 8**

### Type Declarations and @types

Dependency management can be confusing in any language, and TypeScript is no

exception. In fact, because types are often shipped as separate packages, dependencies

in TypeScript can be especially bewildering.

This chapter will help you build a mental model for how dependencies work in Type‐

Script and show you how to sort through some of the issues that can come up with

them. It will also help you craft your own type declaration files to publish and share

with others. By writing great type declarations, you can help not just your own

project but the entire TypeScript community.

### Item 65: Put TypeScript and @types in devDependencies

The Node Package Manager, npm, is ubiquitous in the JavaScript world. It provides

both a repository of JavaScript libraries (the npm registry) and a way to specify which

versions of them you depend on (package.json).

npm draws a distinction between a few types of dependencies, each of which goes in a

separate section of package.json:

dependencies

```
These are packages that are required to run your JavaScript. If you import lodash
at runtime, then it should go in dependencies. When you publish your code on
npm and another user installs it, it will also install these dependencies. (These are
known as transitive dependencies.)
```
devDependencies

```
These packages are used to develop and test your code but are not required at
runtime. Your test framework is an example of a devDependency. Unlike depen
dencies, these are not installed transitively with your packages.
```
##### 283


peerDependencies

```
These are packages that you require at runtime but don’t want to be responsible
for tracking. If you publish a React component, for example, it will be compatible
with a range of versions of React itself. You’d prefer that the user select one,
rather than you choosing for them, which could result in multiple versions of
React running on the same page.
```
Of these, dependencies and devDependencies are by far the most common. As you

use TypeScript, be aware of which type of dependency you’re adding. Because Type‐

Script is a development tool and TypeScript types do not exist at runtime (Item 3),

packages related to TypeScript generally belong in devDependencies.

The first dependency to consider is TypeScript itself. While you can install TypeScript

system-wide, this is a bad idea for two main reasons:

- There’s no guarantee that you and your coworkers will always have the same ver‐
    sion installed.
- It adds a step to your project setup.

Make TypeScript a devDependency instead. That way you and your coworkers will

always get the correct version when you run npm install. You update TypeScript the

same way you’d update any other package.

Your IDE and build tools will happily discover a version of TypeScript installed in this

way. On the command line, for example, you can use npx to run the version of tsc

installed by npm:

```
$ npx tsc
```
The next type of dependency to consider is type dependencies or @types. If a library

itself does not come with TypeScript type declarations, then you may still be able to

find typings on DefinitelyTyped, a community-maintained collection of type defini‐

tions for JavaScript libraries. Type definitions from DefinitelyTyped are published on

the npm registry under the @types scope: @types/jquery has type definitions for

jQuery, @types/lodash has types for Lodash, and so on. These @types packages only

contain the types. They don’t contain the implementation.

Your @types dependencies should also be devDependencies, even if the package itself

is a direct dependency. For example, to depend on React and its type declarations,

you might run:

```
$ npm install react
```
```
$ npm install --save-dev @types/react
```
**284 | Chapter 8: Type Declarations and @types**


This will result in a package.json file that looks something like this:

```
{
"devDependencies" : {
"@types/react" : "^18.2.23",
"typescript" : "^5.2.2"
},
"dependencies" : {
"react" : "^18.2.0"
}
}
```
The idea here is that you should publish JavaScript, not TypeScript, and your Java‐

Script does not depend on the @types when you run it. (TypeScript users might

depend on these @types, but transitive types dependencies are best avoided. Item 70

will show you how.)

What if you’re building a web app, with no intentions to ever publish it as a library

on npm? You may find advice to the effect that it’s not worth separating out

devDependencies in this situation, and that you may as well just make everything a

prod dependency. Even for a web app, though, putting @types in devDependencies

has a few advantages:

- If your app has a server component, you can run npm install --production to
    only install prod dependencies in your production image. Assuming you’ve com‐
    piled your TypeScript to JavaScript already, these will be the only dependencies
    you need to run your code. This will result in a slimmer image that spins up
    more quickly.
- If you’re using an automated dependency update tool (such as Renovate or
    Dependabot), you can tell it to prioritize production dependencies. These are the
    ones that are more likely to have important security updates that could affect end
    users of your code, and these are the ones that you should focus on.

There are a few things that can go wrong with @types dependencies, and the next

item will delve deeper into this topic.

**Things to Remember**

- Understand the difference between dependencies and devDependencies in
    package.json.
- Put TypeScript in your project’s devDependencies. Don’t install TypeScript
    system-wide.
- Put @types dependencies in devDependencies, not dependencies.

```
Item 65: Put TypeScript and @types in devDependencies | 285
```

### Item 66: Understand the Three Versions Involved in Type Declarations

Dependency management rarely conjures up happy feelings for software developers.

Usually, you just want to use a library and not think too much about whether its tran‐

sitive dependencies are compatible with yours.

The bad news is that TypeScript doesn’t make this any better. In fact, it can make

dependency management quite a bit more complicated. This is because instead of

having a single version to worry about, you now have up to three:

- The version of the package
- The version of its type declarations (@types)
- The version of TypeScript

If any of these versions get out of sync with one another, you can run into errors that

may not be clearly related to dependency management. But as the saying goes, “make

things as simple as possible, but no simpler.” Understanding the full complexity of

TypeScript package management will help you diagnose and fix problems. And it will

help you make more informed decisions when it comes time to publish type declara‐

tions of your own.

Here’s how dependencies in TypeScript are supposed to work. You install a package as

a direct dependency, and you install its types as a dev dependency (see Item 65):

```
$ npm install react
+ react@18.2.0
```
```
$ npm install --save-dev @types/react
+ @types/react@18.2.23
```
Note that the major and minor versions (18.2) match but the patch versions (.0

and .23) do not. This is exactly what you want to see. The 18.2 in the @types version

means that these type declarations describe the API of version 18.2 of react. Assum‐

ing the react module follows good semantic versioning hygiene, the patch versions

(18.2.1, 18.2.2, ... ) will not change its public API and will not require updates to

the type declarations. But the type declarations themselves might have bugs or omis‐

sions. The patch versions of the @types module correspond to these sorts of fixes and

additions. In this case, there were many more updates to the type declarations than

the library itself (23 versus 0).

Version matching can go wrong in a few ways.

First, you might update a library but forget to update its type declarations. This often

happens as a result of automatic dependency updating tools such as Dependabot. In

**286 | Chapter 8: Type Declarations and @types**


this case you’ll get type errors whenever you try to use new features of the library. If

there were breaking changes to the library, you might get runtime errors despite your

code passing the type checker.

The solution is usually to update your type declarations so that the versions are back

in sync. If the type declarations have not been updated, you have a few options. You

can use an augmentation in your own project to add new functions and methods that

you’d like to use (Item 71 shows you how). Or you can contribute updated type decla‐

rations back to the community.

Second, your type declarations might get ahead of your library. This can happen if

you’ve been using a library without its typings (perhaps you gave it an any type using

declare module) and try to install them later. If there have been new releases of the

library and its type declarations, your versions might be out of sync. The symptoms

of this are similar to the first problem, just in reverse. The type checker will be com‐

paring your code against the latest API, while you’ll be using an older one at runtime.

The solution is to either upgrade the library or downgrade the type declarations until

they match.

Third, the type declarations might require a newer version of TypeScript than you’re

using in your project. Much of the development of TypeScript’s type system has been

motivated by an attempt to more precisely type popular JavaScript libraries like

Lodash, React, and Ramda. It makes sense that the type declarations for these libra‐

ries would want to use the latest and greatest features to get you better type safety.

You’ll experience this problem as type errors in the @types declarations themselves.

The solution is to do one of the following: upgrade your TypeScript version, use an

older version of the type declarations, or, if you really can’t update TypeScript, stub

out the types with declare module. It is possible for a library to provide different

type declarations for different versions of TypeScript via typesVersions. This is rare

(well under 1% of packages on DefinitelyTyped do so), but you may encounter it in

widely used typings like @types/node and @types/react.

To install @types for a specific version of TypeScript, you can use:

```
npm install --save-dev @types/react@ts4.9
```
The version matching between libraries and their types is best effort and may not

always be correct. But the more popular the library is, the more likely it is that its type

declarations will get this right.

Fourth, you can wind up with duplicate @types dependencies. Say you depend on

@types/foo and @types/bar. If @types/bar depends on an incompatible version of

@types/foo, then npm will attempt to resolve this by installing both versions, one in

a nested folder:

```
Item 66: Understand the Three Versions Involved in Type Declarations | 287
```

```
node_modules/
@types/
foo/
index.d.ts @1.2.3
bar/
index.d.ts
node_modules/
@types/
foo/
index.d.ts @2.3.4
```
While this is sometimes OK for node modules that are used at runtime, it almost cer‐

tainly won’t be OK for type declarations, which live in a flat global namespace. You’ll

see this as errors about duplicate declarations or declarations that cannot be merged.

You can track down why you have a duplicate type declaration by running npm ls

@types/foo. The solution is typically to update your dependency on @types/foo or

@types/bar so that they are compatible.

Transitive @types dependencies like these are often a source of trouble. If you’re pub‐

lishing types, see Item 70 for a way to avoid them. If you have a large number of

duplicated type declarations, it can even become a performance issue for the Type‐

Script compiler. Item 78 dives into this topic in more detail.

Some packages, particularly those written in TypeScript, choose to bundle their own

type declarations. This is usually indicated by a "types" field in their package.json

which points to a .d.ts file:

```
{
"name" : "left-pad",
"version" : "1.3.0",
"description" : "String left pad",
"main" : "index.js",
"types" : "index.d.ts"
// ...
}
```
Does this solve all our problems? Would I even be asking if the answer was “yes”?

Bundling types does solve the problem of version mismatch, particularly if the library

itself is written in TypeScript and the type declarations are generated by tsc (with the

declaration setting). But bundling has some problems of its own.

First, what if there’s an error in the bundled types that can’t be fixed through augmen‐

tation (Item 71)? Or the types worked fine when they were published, but a new

TypeScript version has since been released which flags an error. With @types, you

could depend on the library’s implementation but not its type declarations. But with

bundled types, you lose this option. One bad type declaration might keep you stuck

on an old version of TypeScript. Contrast this with DefinitelyTyped: as TypeScript is

**288 | Chapter 8: Type Declarations and @types**


developed, Microsoft runs it against all the type declarations on DefinitelyTyped.

Breaks are fixed quickly.

Second, what if your types depend on another library’s type declarations? Usually, this

would be a devDependency (Item 65). But if you publish your module and another

user installs it, they won’t get your devDependencies. Type errors will result. On the

other hand, you probably don’t want to make it a direct dependency either, since then

your JavaScript users will install @types modules for no reason. Item 70 discusses the

standard workaround for this situation. But if you publish your types on Definitely‐

Typed, this is not a problem at all: you declare your type dependency there, and only

your TypeScript users will get it.

Some projects adopt a hybrid solution of publishing their TypeScript types as a sepa‐

rate package. This keeps you in control of your own code while still allowing you to

cleanly separate the implementation and type dependency trees.

Third, what if you need to fix an issue with the type declarations of an old version of

your library? Would you be able to go back and release a patch update? DefinitelyTy‐

ped has mechanisms for simultaneously maintaining type declarations for different

versions of the same library, something that might be hard for you to do in your own

project.

Fourth, how committed are you to accepting patches for type declarations? Remem‐

ber, the versions of react and @types/react from the start of this item. There were

far more patch updates to the type declarations than the library itself. DefinitelyTy‐

ped is community maintained and is able to handle this volume. In particular, if a

library maintainer doesn’t look at a patch within five days, a global maintainer will.

Can you commit to a similar turnaround time for your library?

Managing dependencies in TypeScript can be challenging, but it does come with

rewards: well-written type declarations can help you learn how to use libraries cor‐

rectly and can greatly improve your productivity with them. As you run into issues

with dependency management, keep the three versions in mind.

If you are publishing packages, weigh the pros and cons of bundling type declarations

versus publishing them on DefinitelyTyped. The official recommendation is to bun‐

dle type declarations only if the library is written in TypeScript. This works well in

practice since tsc can automatically generate type declarations for you (by using the

declaration compiler option). For JavaScript libraries, handcrafted type declarations

are more likely to contain errors, and they’ll require more updates. If you publish

your type declarations on DefinitelyTyped, the community will help you support and

maintain them.

```
Item 66: Understand the Three Versions Involved in Type Declarations | 289
```

**Things to Remember**

- There are three versions involved in an @types dependency: the library version,
    the @types version, and the TypeScript version.
- Recognize the symptoms of different types of version mismatch.
- If you update a library, make sure you update the corresponding @types.
- Understand the pros and cons of bundling types versus publishing them on
    DefinitelyTyped. Prefer bundling types if your library is written in TypeScript,
    and DefinitelyTyped if it is not.

### Item 67: Export All Types That Appear in Public APIs

Use TypeScript long enough and you’ll eventually find yourself wanting to use a type

or interface from a third-party library, only to find that it isn’t exported. This is just

a nuisance for library users. As you’ll see, any type that’s part of a public API is effec‐

tively exported anyway, even if not explicitly. As a library author, this means that you

ought to just export your types to begin with as a convenience to your users.

Suppose you want to create some private, unexported types:

```
interface SecretName {
first: string ;
last: string ;
}
```
```
interface SecretSanta {
name: SecretName;
gift: string ;
}
```
```
export function getGift(name: SecretName, gift: string ): SecretSanta {
// ...
}
```
As a user of your module, I cannot directly import SecretName or SecretSanta, only

getGift. But this is more an annoyance than a firm barrier: because those types

appear in an exported function signature, I can extract them. One way is to use the

Parameters and ReturnType generic types:

```
type MySanta = ReturnType< typeof getGift>;
// ^? type MySanta = SecretSanta
type MyName = Parameters< typeof getGift>[0];
// ^? type MyName = SecretName
```
If your goal in not exporting these types was to preserve flexibility, then the jig is up!

You’ve already committed to them by putting them in a public API. Do your users a

favor and export them.

**290 | Chapter 8: Type Declarations and @types**


**Things to Remember**

- Export types that appear in any form in any public method. Your users will be
    able to extract them anyway, so you may as well make it easy for them.

### Item 68: Use TSDoc for API Comments

Here’s a TypeScript function to generate a greeting:

```
// Generate a greeting. Result is formatted for display.
function greet(name: string , title: string ) {
return `Hello ${title} ${name}`;
}
```
The author was kind enough to leave a comment describing what this function does.

But for documentation intended to be read by users of your functions, it’s better to

use JSDoc-style comments:

```
/** Generate a greeting. Result is formatted for display. */
function greetJSDoc(name: string , title: string ) {
return `Hello ${title} ${name}`;
}
```
The reason is that there is a nearly universal convention in editors to surface JSDoc-

style comments when the function is called (see Figure 8-1).

Figure 8-1. JSDoc-style comments are shown in tooltips in your editor.

The inline comment, in contrast, gets no such treatment (see Figure 8-2).

Figure 8-2. Inline comments are typically not shown in tooltips.

The TypeScript language service supports this convention, and you should take

advantage of it. If a comment describes a public API, it should be JSDoc. In the con‐

text of TypeScript, these comments are sometimes called TSDoc. You can use many of

the usual conventions like @param and @returns:

```
Item 68: Use TSDoc for API Comments | 291
```

##### /**

```
* Generate a greeting.
* @param name Name of the person to greet
* @param title The person's title
* @returns A greeting formatted for human consumption.
*/
function greetFullTSDoc(name: string , title: string ) {
return `Hello ${title} ${name}`;
}
```
This lets editors show the relevant documentation for each parameter as you’re writ‐

ing out a function call (as shown in Figure 8-3). Only the documentation for the name

parameter is shown here, not title.

Figure 8-3. An @param annotation lets your editor show documentation for the current

parameter as you type it.

You can also use TSDoc with type definitions:

```
/** A measurement performed at a time and place. */
interface Measurement {
/** Where was the measurement made? */
position: Vector3D;
/** When was the measurement made? In seconds since epoch. */
time: number ;
/** Observed momentum */
momentum: Vector3D;
}
```
As you inspect individual fields in a Measurement object, you’ll get contextual docu‐

mentation (see Figure 8-4).

Figure 8-4. TSDoc for a field is shown when you mouse over that field in your editor.

**292 | Chapter 8: Type Declarations and @types**


The documentation on individual fields is carried along through mapped types so

long as they are “homomorphic” (see Item 15). This includes helper types such as

Partial and Pick.

You can use the @template tag to document type parameters for generic types. Item

50 shows how this works.

TSDoc comments are formatted using Markdown, so if you want to use bold, italic,

or bulleted lists, you can (see Figure 8-5).

Figure 8-5. TSDoc comments can include Markdown formatting.

Try to avoid writing essays in your documentation, though. The best comments are

short and to the point.

JSDoc includes some conventions for specifying type information (@param {string}

name ...), but you should avoid these in favor of TypeScript types (Item 31).

Finally, you should mark deprecated symbols using the @deprecated tag. Not only

does this provide a clear indication that a function is deprecated, it also enables the

most aggressive TSDoc feature of all: @deprecated symbols are typically rendered

using strikethrough text. This means you don’t even need to inspect a symbol to

know it’s deprecated, as you can see in Figure 8-6.

Figure 8-6. Symbols marked with the @deprecated tag are struck through.

```
Item 68: Use TSDoc for API Comments | 293
```

If you mark a method as deprecated, do your users a favor and say what the new

alternative is. At the very least, include a reference to documentation on the

deprecation.

**Things to Remember**

- Use JSDoc-/TSDoc-formatted comments to document exported functions,
    classes, and types. This helps editors surface information for your users when it’s
    most relevant.
- Use @param, @returns, and Markdown for formatting.
- Avoid including type information in documentation (see Item 31).
- Mark deprecated APIs with @deprecated.

### Item 69: Provide a Type for this in Callbacks if It’s Part of Their API

JavaScript’s this keyword is one of the most notoriously confusing parts of the lan‐

guage. Unlike variables declared with let or const, which are lexically scoped, this is

dynamically scoped: its value depends not on where it appears in your code but on

how you get there.

this is most often used in classes, where it typically references the current instance of

an object:

```
class C {
vals = [1, 2, 3];
logSquares() {
for ( const val of this .vals) {
console.log(val ** 2);
}
}
}
```
```
const c = new C();
c.logSquares();
```
This logs:

```
1
4
9
```
**294 | Chapter 8: Type Declarations and @types**


Now look what happens if you try to put logSquares in a variable and call that:

```
const c = new C();
const method = c.logSquares;
method();
```
This version throws an error at runtime:

```
for (const val of this.vals) {
^
```
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'vals')
```
The problem is that c.logSquares() actually does two things: it calls

C.prototype.logSquares and it binds the value of this in that function to c. By

pulling out a reference to logSquares, you’ve separated these, and this gets set to

undefined.

JavaScript gives you complete control over this binding. You can use call to explic‐

itly set this and fix the problem:

```
const c = new C();
const method = c.logSquares;
method.call(c); // Logs the squares again
```
There’s no reason that this had to be bound to an instance of C. It could have been

bound to anything. So libraries can, and do, make the value of this part of their APIs.

Even the DOM does this in event handlers, for instance:

```
document.querySelector('input')?.addEventListener('change', function (e) {
console.log( this ); // Logs the input element on which the event fired.
});
```
this binding often comes up in the context of callbacks like this one. If you want to

define an onClick handler in a class, for example, you might try this:

```
class ResetButton {
render() {
return makeButton({text: 'Reset', onClick: this .onClick});
}
onClick() {
alert(`Reset ${ this }`);
}
}
```
When a user clicks the button, it will alert with “Reset undefined.” Oops! As usual, the

culprit is this binding. A common solution is to create a bound version of the

method in the constructor:

```
class ResetButton {
constructor () {
this .onClick = this .onClick.bind( this );
}
```
```
Item 69: Provide a Type for this in Callbacks if It’s Part of Their API | 295
```

```
render() {
return makeButton({text: 'Reset', onClick: this .onClick});
}
onClick() {
alert(`Reset ${ this }`);
}
}
```
The onClick() { ... } definition defines a property on ResetButton.prototype.

This is shared by all instances of ResetButton. When you bind this.onClick = ...

in the constructor, it creates a property called onClick on the instance of

ResetButton with this bound to that instance. The onClick instance property comes

before the onClick prototype property in the lookup sequence, so this.onClick

refers to the bound function in the render() method.

There is a shorthand for this binding that is extremely convenient:

```
class ResetButton {
render() {
return makeButton({text: 'Reset', onClick: this .onClick});
}
onClick = () => {
alert(`Reset ${ this }`); // "this" refers to the ResetButton instance.
}
}
```
Here we’ve replaced onClick with an arrow function. This will define a new function

every time a ResetButton is constructed with this set to the appropriate value. It’s

instructive to look at the generated JavaScript:

```
class ResetButton {
constructor() {
this .onClick = () => {
alert(`Reset ${ this }`); // "this" refers to the ResetButton instance.
};
}
render() {
return makeButton({ text: 'Reset', onClick: this .onClick });
}
}
```
So what does this all have to do with TypeScript? Because this binding is part of

JavaScript, TypeScript models it. This means that if you’re writing (or typing) a

library that sets the value of this on callbacks, then you should model it, too.

You can do so by adding a this parameter to your callback:

```
function addKeyListener(
el: HTMLElement,
listener: ( this : HTMLElement, e: KeyboardEvent) => void
) {
```
**296 | Chapter 8: Type Declarations and @types**


```
el.addEventListener('keydown', e => listener.call(el, e));
}
```
The this parameter is special: it’s not just another positional argument. You can see

this if you try to call it with two parameters:

```
function addKeyListener(
el: HTMLElement,
listener: ( this : HTMLElement, e: KeyboardEvent) => void
) {
el.addEventListener('keydown', e => {
listener(el, e);
// ~ Expected 1 arguments, but got 2
});
}
```
Even better, TypeScript will enforce that you call the function with the correct this

context:

```
function addKeyListener(
el: HTMLElement,
listener: ( this : HTMLElement, e: KeyboardEvent) => void
) {
el.addEventListener('keydown', e => {
listener(e);
// ~~~~~~~~ The 'this' context of type 'void' is not assignable
// to method's 'this' of type 'HTMLElement'
});
}
```
As a user of this function, you can reference this in the callback and get full type

safety:

```
declare let el: HTMLElement;
addKeyListener(el, function (e) {
console.log( this .innerHTML);
// ^? this: HTMLElement
});
```
Of course, if you use an arrow function here, you’ll override the value of this. Type‐

Script will catch the issue:

```
class Foo {
registerHandler(el: HTMLElement) {
addKeyListener(el, e => {
console.log( this .innerHTML);
// ~~~~~~~~~ Property 'innerHTML' does not exist on 'Foo'
});
}
}
```
Don’t forget about this! If you set the value of this in your callbacks, then it’s part of

your API, and you should include it in your type declarations.

```
Item 69: Provide a Type for this in Callbacks if It’s Part of Their API | 297
```

If you’re designing a new API, try not to use dynamic this binding. While it was his‐

torically popular, it has always been a source of confusion, and the prevalence of

arrow functions makes this sort of API much harder to use in modern JavaScript.

**Things to Remember**

- Understand how this binding works.
- Provide a type for this in callbacks if it’s part of your API.
- Avoid dynamic this binding in new APIs.

### Item 70: Mirror Types to Sever Dependencies

Suppose you’ve written a library for parsing CSV files. Its API is simple: you pass in

the contents of the CSV file and get back a list of objects mapping column names to

values.

As a convenience for your Node.js users, you allow the contents to be either a string

or a Node.js Buffer:

```
// parse-csv.ts
import {Buffer} from 'node:buffer';
```
```
function parseCSV(contents: string | Buffer): {[column: string ]: string }[] {
if ( typeof contents === 'object') {
// It's a buffer
return parseCSV(contents.toString('utf8'));
}
// ...
}
```
The type definition for Buffer comes from the Node.js type declarations, which you

must install:

```
npm install --save-dev @types/node
```
Here we’re following the advice of Item 65 by making @types dev dependencies rather

than production dependencies.

When you publish your CSV parsing library, you generate type declarations using

--declaration and bundle them with it. Here’s what the generated .d.ts file looks

like:

```
// parse-csv.d.ts
import { Buffer } from 'node:buffer';
export declare function parseCSV(contents: string | Buffer): {
[column: string ]: string ;
}[];
```
**298 | Chapter 8: Type Declarations and @types**


If you take this approach, the JavaScript users of your library will be happy, but Type‐

Script web developers will not be. You’ll get complaints from them that they’re getting

an error from your library:

```
Cannot find module 'node:buffer' or its corresponding type declarations.
```
Because we’ve made @types/node a devDependency, it’s not installed with our pack‐

age, even though our types, which are part of our package, depend on it.

So should we make @types/node a prod dependency? This will make the error go

away, but now you’re likely to get a different set of complaints:

- JavaScript developers will wonder what these @types modules are that they’re
    depending on.
- TypeScript web developers will wonder why they’re depending on Node.js.
- TypeScript developers using a different version of Node.js will wonder why they
    have duplicated type definitions.

These complaints are reasonable. The Buffer behavior isn’t essential and is only rele‐

vant for users who are using Node.js already. And the declaration in @types/node is

only relevant to Node.js users who are also using TypeScript. The @types/node pack‐

age is not small (nearly 100k lines of code), and our library only uses a very tiny part

of it.

TypeScript’s structural typing (Item 4) can help you out of the jam. Rather than using

the declaration of Buffer from @types/node, you can write your own with just the

methods and properties you need. In this case that’s just a toString method that can

accept an encoding:

```
export interface CsvBuffer {
toString(encoding?: string ): string ;
}
export function parseCSV(
contents: string | CsvBuffer
): {[column: string ]: string }[] {
// ...
}
```
This interface is dramatically shorter than the complete one, but it does capture our

(simple) needs from a Buffer. In a Node.js project, calling parseCSV with a real

Buffer is still OK because the types are compatible:

```
parseCSV( new Buffer("column1,column2\nval1,val2", "utf-8")); // OK
```
```
Item 70: Mirror Types to Sever Dependencies | 299
```

Looking again at the CsvBuffer interface, there’s nothing about it that’s specific to

CSV files. Giving it a more “structural” name can reinforce this:

```
/** Anything convertible to a string with an encoding, e.g. a Node buffer. */
export interface StringEncodable {
toString(encoding?: string ): string ;
}
```
Since it’s important that a Node Buffer is assignable to StringEncodable (the com‐

ment says as much!), you should write a unit test that verifies this:

```
import {Buffer} from 'node:buffer';
import {parseCSV} from './parse-csv';
```
```
test('parse CSV in a buffer', () => {
expect(
parseCSV( new Buffer("column1,column2\nval1,val2", "utf-8"))
).toEqual(
[{column1: 'val1', column2: 'val2'}]
);
});
```
This test verifies both the runtime behavior of your code and the assignability of a

Node Buffer to StringEncodable. The test imports node:buffer, but that’s fine

because @types/node can be a devDependency without affecting users of your library.

If your code starts using more methods from the Buffer interface, then you’ll need to

add them to your version of this interface as well. This may feel duplicative but, as

they say in the Go Language community, “a little copying is better than a little

dependency.” If you depend on a large portion of another library’s types, you may

choose to formalize this copying by vendoring the dependency.

In any case, by severing the @types dependency you get a good experience for Java‐

Script and all kinds of TypeScript developers. If the @types dependency had depen‐

dencies of its own, then you may sever an entire dependency tree, which can have a

large positive impact on compiler performance (Item 78).

This technique is also helpful for severing dependencies between your unit tests and

production systems. See the getAuthors example in Item 4.

**Things to Remember**

- Avoid transitive type dependencies in published npm modules.
- Use structural typing to sever dependencies that are nonessential.
- Don’t force JavaScript users to depend on @types. Don’t force web developers to
    depend on Node.js.

### Item 71: Use Module Augmentation to Improve Types

JavaScript famously has some “bad parts,” like implicit globals and type coercions.

Most of these were design decisions made in the halcyon days of the mid-90s that

have proven extremely hard to reverse.

TypeScript has a few historical warts of its own. One of these is the type declaration

for JSON.parse, which returns any:

```
declare let apiResponse: string ;
```
```
const response = JSON.parse(apiResponse);
const cacheExpirationTime = response.lastModified + 3600;
// ^? const cacheExpirationTime: any
```
If you fail to give response a type, it will quietly spread any types throughout your

code. As Item 5 explained, this will undermine type safety, thwart language services,

and generally give you a poor experience with TypeScript.

It would be better if JSON.parse returned unknown which, as Item 46 explained, can

be used as a type-safe alternative to any. So why doesn’t it? It’s because the unknown

type was only introduced in TypeScript 3.0, which came out in July of 2018. Enor‐

mous amounts of TypeScript code had been written before then, and changing the

return type of JSON.parse would have been extremely disruptive. So the TypeScript

team made a concession to pragmatism. Future code will be a bit less safe, but exist‐

ing code won’t break.

But just because the TypeScript team decided to keep this type signature doesn’t mean

that you have to. Recall from Item 13 that interfaces have a special power that type

aliases do not: they participate in “declaration merging,” where repeated definitions of

the same interface are merged to form a final result.

We can use this to change the type signature of JSON.parse. Here’s what it looks like

(in lib.es5.d.ts):

```
interface JSON {
parse(
text: string ,
reviver?: ( this : any , key: string , value: any ) => any
): any ;
// ...
}
declare var JSON: JSON;
```
We’re interested in the interface. If you define your own interface JSON in a type

declaration file in your project, TypeScript will merge it with the library declarations.

```
// declarations/safe-json.d.ts
interface JSON {
parse(
```
```
Item 71: Use Module Augmentation to Improve Types | 301
```

```
text: string ,
reviver?: ( this : any , key: string , value: any ) => any
): unknown ;
}
```
Note the changed return type. The result is similar to a TypeScript function overload

(Item 52). Since libs are loaded before our code, our overload will always win. The

result is that JSON.parse now returns unknown:

```
const response = JSON.parse(apiResponse);
// ^? const response: unknown
const cacheExpirationTime = response.lastModified + 3600;
// ~~~~~~~~ response is of type 'unknown'.
```
Using it requires a type assertion, which is exactly what you want:

```
interface ApiResponse {
lastModified: number ;
}
const response = JSON.parse(apiResponse) as ApiResponse;
const cacheExpirationTime = response.lastModified + 3600; // ok
// ^? const cacheExpirationTime: number
```
You can do something similar for the fetch API’s Response.prototype.json(),

which also returns any. Here’s a fix:

```
// declarations/safe-response.d.ts
interface Body {
json(): Promise< unknown >;
}
```
These changes were clear wins. But since you’re only making changes that affect your

own code, you’re also free to make more controversial changes that would never fly in

the broader TypeScript ecosystem.

For example, it’s part of the language spec that the Set constructor can take a string.

This results in something that might not be what you expect:

```
> new Set('abc')
Set(3) { 'a', 'b', 'c' }
```
If your intention was to create a one-element set containing 'abc', then this might

introduce bugs in your code. Since the type of both would be Set<string>, and this is

how JavaScript works, TypeScript can’t help you catch this mistake.

But there’s no reason you can’t ban calling the Set constructor with a string in your

own code. It’s a little more difficult than changing the return type of JSON.parse, but

it all comes back to declaration merging.

Here’s the declaration of Set from lib.es2015.collections.d.ts:

```
interface Set<T> {
add(value: T): this ;
```
**302 | Chapter 8: Type Declarations and @types**


```
delete (value: T): boolean ;
has(value: T): boolean ;
readonly size: number ;
// ...
}
```
```
interface SetConstructor {
new <T = any >(values?: readonly T[] | null ): Set<T>;
readonly prototype: Set< any >;
}
declare var Set: SetConstructor;
```
There’s also an overload of the constructor in lib.es2015.iterable.d.ts:

```
interface SetConstructor {
new <T>(iterable?: Iterable<T> | null ): Set<T>;
}
```
This is the one we’d like to “knock out.” Here’s how:

```
// declarations/ban-set-string-constructor.d.ts:
interface SetConstructor {
new (str: string ): void ;
}
```
With this in place, constructing a Set with a string still won’t produce a type error.

But it will return void, so trying to do anything with the result will give you a clue

that something is amiss:

```
const s = new Set('abc');
// ^? const s: void
console.log(s.has('abc'));
// ~~~ Property 'has' does not exist on type 'void'.
const otherSet: Set< string > = s;
// ~~~~~~~~ Type 'void' is not assignable to type 'Set<string>'.
```
To give users a stronger hint what’s going on, you could have the Set constructor

return a string literal type containing an error. You can also mark this constructor

@deprecated to make it appear struck-through in your user’s editor (Item 68):

```
interface SetConstructor {
/** @deprecated */
new (str: string ): 'Error! new Set(string) is banned.';
}
```
```
const s = new Set('abc');
// ^? const s: "Error! new Set(string) is banned."
```
None of these is a perfect solution: it would be better if we produced a type error

when you constructed the Set, rather than producing an unusable type. But that’s not

possible in TypeScript, and this is what real-world applications of this technique often

wind up looking like.

```
Item 71: Use Module Augmentation to Improve Types | 303
```

Of course, with great power comes great responsibility. Here are a few things to be

aware of:

- As with all type-level constructs, this only affects type checking. The runtime
    behavior of JSON.parse and the Set constructor are not affected, either in your
    own code or in library code.
- This technique is best used either to make the built-in types stricter and more
    precise, or to disallow certain things. If you add declarations that don’t reflect
    reality at runtime, you can create a confusing situation. As Item 40 explained,
    incorrect types can be worse than no types.
- We “knocked out” the Set constructor by making it return void or an error
    string. But this won’t work as well if you want to ban a function or method that
    already returns void.

We used declaration merging to improve built-in types, but the same technique can

be used for third-party @types and bundled type declarations as well. You can find a

collection of improvements to the built-in types in the ts-reset npm package.

**Things to Remember**

- Use declaration merging to improve existing APIs or disallow problematic
    constructs.
- Use void or error string returns to “knock out” methods and mark them
    @deprecated.
- Remember that overloads only apply at the type level. Don’t make the types
    diverge from reality.

**304 | Chapter 8: Type Declarations and @types**


**CHAPTER 9**

### Writing and Running Your Code

This chapter is a bit of a grab bag: it covers some issues that come up in writing code

(not types) as well as issues you may run into when you run your code.

### Item 72: Prefer ECMAScript Features to TypeScript Features

The relationship between TypeScript and JavaScript has changed over time. When

Microsoft first started work on TypeScript in 2010, the prevailing attitude around

JavaScript was that it was a problematic language that needed to be fixed. It was com‐

mon for frameworks and source-to-source compilers to add missing features like

classes, decorators, and a module system to JavaScript. TypeScript was no different.

Early versions included home-grown versions of classes, enums, and modules.

Over time, TC39, the standards body that governs JavaScript, added many of these

same features to the core JavaScript language. And the features they added were not

compatible with the versions that existed in TypeScript. This left the TypeScript team

in an awkward predicament: adopt the new features from the standard or maintain

existing code?

TypeScript has largely chosen to do the former and eventually articulated its current

governing principle: TC39 defines the runtime, while TypeScript innovates solely in

the type space.

There are a few remaining features from before this decision. It’s important to recog‐

nize and understand these, because they don’t fit the pattern of the rest of the lan‐

guage. In general, I recommend avoiding them to keep the relationship between

TypeScript and JavaScript as clear as possible. This will also ensure that your code is

##### 305


compatible with alternative TypeScript compilers and won’t break as a result of future

standards alignment.

If you follow this advice, you can think of TypeScript as “JavaScript with types.”

**Enums**

Many languages model types that can take on a small set of values using enumerations

or enums. TypeScript adds them to JavaScript:

```
enum Flavor {
Vanilla = 0,
Chocolate = 1,
Strawberry = 2,
}
```
```
let flavor = Flavor.Chocolate;
// ^? let flavor: Flavor
```
```
Flavor // Autocomplete shows: Vanilla, Chocolate, Strawberry
Flavor[0] // Value is "Vanilla"
```
The argument for enums is that they provide more safety and transparency than bare

numbers. But enums in TypeScript have some quirks. There are actually several var‐

iants on enums that all have subtly different behaviors:

Number-valued enum (like Flavor)

```
The number type is assignable to this, so it’s not very safe. (It was designed this
way to make bit flag structures possible.)
```
String-valued enum

```
This does offer type safety, and also more informative values at runtime. But it’s
not structurally typed, unlike every other type in TypeScript (more on this
momentarily).
```
const enum

```
Unlike regular enums, const enums go away completely at runtime. If you
changed to const enum Flavor in the previous example, the compiler would
rewrite Flavor.Chocolate as 1. This also breaks our expectations around how
the compiler behaves and still has the divergent behaviors between string and
number-valued enums.
```
const enum with the preserveConstEnums flag set

This emits runtime code for const enums, just like for a regular enum.

That string-valued enums are nominally typed comes as a particular surprise, since

every other type in TypeScript uses structural typing for assignability (Item 4):

**306 | Chapter 9: Writing and Running Your Code**


```
enum Flavor {
Vanilla = 'vanilla',
Chocolate = 'chocolate',
Strawberry = 'strawberry',
}
```
```
let favoriteFlavor = Flavor.Chocolate; // Type is Flavor
favoriteFlavor = 'strawberry';
// ~~~~~~~~~~~ Type '"strawberry"' is not assignable to type 'Flavor'
```
This has implications when you publish a library. Suppose you have a function that

takes a Flavor:

```
function scoop(flavor: Flavor) { /* ... */ }
```
Because a Flavor at runtime is really just a string, it’s fine for your JavaScript users to

call it with one:

```
scoop('vanilla'); // OK in JavaScript
```
but your TypeScript users will need to import the enum and use that instead:

```
scoop('vanilla');
// ~~~~~~~~~ '"vanilla"' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Flavor'
```
```
import {Flavor} from 'ice-cream';
scoop(Flavor.Vanilla); // OK
```
These divergent experiences for JavaScript and TypeScript users are a reason to avoid

string-valued enums.

TypeScript offers an alternative to enums that is less common in other languages: a

union of literal types.

```
type Flavor = 'vanilla' | 'chocolate' | 'strawberry';
```
```
let favoriteFlavor: Flavor = 'chocolate'; // OK
favoriteFlavor = 'americone dream';
// ~~~~~~~~~~~ Type '"americone dream"' is not assignable to type 'Flavor'
```
This offers as much safety as the enum and has the advantage of translating more

directly to JavaScript. It also provides autocomplete in your editor, as shown in

Figure 9-1.

Figure 9-1. TypeScript offering autocomplete for a union of string literal types.

For more on unions of string literal types, see Item 35.

```
Item 72: Prefer ECMAScript Features to TypeScript Features | 307
```

What about numeric enums, like our initial definition of Flavor? If you have the

option, strongly consider using strings for your values instead. Numeric enums don’t

offer the safety you expect, and they’re harder to work with than strings. Which

would you rather see in your JavaScript debugger or in a network request,

{"flavor": 1} or {"flavor": "chocolate"}?

**Parameter Properties**

It’s common to assign constructor parameters to properties when initializing a class:

```
class Person {
name: string ;
constructor (name: string ) {
this .name = name;
}
}
```
TypeScript provides a more compact syntax for this:

```
class Person {
constructor ( public name: string ) {}
}
```
This is called a “parameter property,” and it is equivalent to the code in the first exam‐

ple. There are a few issues to be aware of with parameter properties:

- They are one of the few constructs that generate code when you compile to Java‐
    Script (enums are another). Generally, compilation just involves erasing types.
- Because the parameter is only used in generated code, the source looks like it has
    unused parameters.
- A mix of parameter and nonparameter properties can hide the design of your
    classes.

For example:

```
class Person {
first: string ;
last: string ;
constructor ( public name: string ) {
[ this .first, this .last] = name.split(' ');
}
}
```
This class has three properties (first, last, name), but this is hard to read off the

code because only two are listed before the constructor. This gets worse if the con‐

structor takes other parameters, too.

**308 | Chapter 9: Writing and Running Your Code**


If your class consists only of parameter properties and no methods, you might con‐

sider making it an interface and using object literals. Remember that the two are

assignable to one another because of structural typing (Item 4):

```
class PersonClass {
constructor ( public name: string ) {}
}
const p: Person Class = { name: 'Jed Bartlet' }; // OK
```
```
interface Person {
name: string ;
}
const jed: Person = new PersonClass('Jed Bartlet'); // also OK
```
Opinions are divided on parameter properties. While I generally avoid them, others

appreciate the saved keystrokes. Be aware that they do not fit the pattern of the rest of

TypeScript, however, and may in fact obscure that pattern for new developers. Try to

avoid hiding the design of your class behind a mix of parameter and nonparameter

properties.

**Namespaces and Triple-Slash Imports**

Before ECMAScript 2015, JavaScript didn’t have an official module system. Different

environments added this missing feature in different ways: Node.js used require and

module.exports, whereas in the browser, the AMD system used a define function

with a callback.

TypeScript also filled this gap with its own module system. This was done using a

module keyword and “triple-slash” imports. After ECMAScript 2015 added an official

module system, TypeScript added namespace as a synonym for module, to avoid

confusion:

```
// other.ts
namespace foo {
export function bar() {}
}
```
```
// index.ts
/// <reference path="other.ts"/>
foo.bar();
```
Outside of type declaration files, triple-slash imports and the module keyword are just

a historical curiosity. In your own code, you should use ECMASCript 2015-style

modules (import and export).

```
Item 72: Prefer ECMAScript Features to TypeScript Features | 309
```

**experimentalDecorators**

Decorators can be used to annotate or modify classes, methods, and properties. If a

symbol is preceded by an @ sign, then it’s a decorator. They’re common in Angular

and several other frameworks.

In 2015, TypeScript added support for a draft proposal of decorators in order to sup‐

port Angular. This was gated behind the --experimentalDecorators flag.

Eight years later, in 2023, the decorators proposal reached stage 3 in a very different

form. You can use standard decorators without any flags. Here’s what an ECMAScript

standard decorator looks like:

```
class Greeter {
greeting: string ;
constructor (message: string ) {
this .greeting = message;
}
@logged // <-- this is the decorator
greet() {
return `Hello, ${ this .greeting}`;
}
}
```
```
function logged(originalFn: any , context: ClassMethodDecoratorContext) {
return function ( this : any , ...args: any []) {
console.log(`Calling ${String(context.name)}`);
return originalFn.call( this , ...args);
};
}
```
```
console.log( new Greeter('Dave').greet());
// Logs:
// Calling greet
// Hello, Dave
```
You can tell which version of decorators you’re using by checking for experimental

Decorators in your tsconfig.json. If it’s set, then you’re using nonstandard decorators.

If you’re able to, turn this off! But you may be forced to keep this setting by a library

or framework, at least until it adopts the latest standards.

If you are using experimentalDecorators, try not to dig the hole deeper by writing

your own nonstandard decorators. You’ll eventually have to migrate these to the stan‐

dard version.

**310 | Chapter 9: Writing and Running Your Code**


If you don’t have this flag set, then feel free to write decorators to your heart’s content.

Just remember that decorators aren’t the best solution to all problems and can some‐

times make your code harder to follow. Try to avoid decorators that change a meth‐

od’s type signature, for example.

**Member Visibility Modifiers (Private, Protected, and Public)**

Historically, JavaScript lacked a way to make the properties and methods of a class

private. The usual workaround was a convention that underscore-prefixed fields

weren’t part of a class’s public API:

```
class Foo {
_private = 'secret123';
}
```
But this only discourages users from accessing private data. It’s easy to circumvent:

```
const f = new Foo();
f._private; // 'secret123'
```
TypeScript adds public, protected, and private field visibility modifiers that seem

to provide some enforcement:

```
class Diary {
private secret = 'cheated on my English test';
}
```
```
const diary = new Diary();
diary.secret
// ~~~~~~ Property 'secret' is private and only accessible within ... 'Diary'
```
But private is a feature of the type system and, as Item 3 explained, features of the

type system all go away at runtime. Here’s what this snippet looks like when Type‐

Script compiles it to JavaScript:

```
class Diary {
constructor() {
this .secret = 'cheated on my English test';
}
}
const diary = new Diary();
diary.secret;
```
The private indicator is gone, and your secret is out! Much like the _private con‐

vention, TypeScript’s visibility modifiers only discourage you from accessing private

data. You can even access a private property from within TypeScript using a type

assertion or iteration:

```
Item 72: Prefer ECMAScript Features to TypeScript Features | 311
```

```
const diary = new Diary();
(diary as any ).secret // OK
```
```
console.log(Object.entries(diary));
// logs [["secret", "cheated on my English test"]]
```
ES2022 officially added support for private fields. Unlike TypeScript’s private,

ECMAScript’s private is enforced both for type checking and at runtime. To use it,

prefix your class property with a #:

```
class PasswordChecker {
#passwordHash: number ;
```
```
constructor (passwordHash: number ) {
this .#passwordHash = passwordHash;
}
```
```
checkPassword(password: string ) {
return hash(password) === this .#passwordHash;
}
}
```
```
const checker = new PasswordChecker(hash('s3cret'));
checker.#passwordHash
// ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Property '#passwordHash' is not accessible outside class
// 'PasswordChecker' because it has a private identifier.
checker.checkPassword('secret'); // Returns false
checker.checkPassword('s3cret'); // Returns true
```
The #passwordHash property is not accessible from outside the class and is not enu‐

merable. Even for targets of that don’t natively support private fields (ES2021 or ear‐

lier), there’s a fallback implementation that will keep your data private. ECMAScript

private fields are standard, widely supported, and more secure than TypeScript’s

private. You should use them instead.

What about public and protected? In JavaScript (and TypeScript), public is the

default visibility so there’s no need to annotate this explicitly. And while private

implies encapsulation, protected implies inheritance. The general rule in object-

oriented programming is to prefer composition over inheritance, so practical uses of

protected are quite rare.

readonly as a field modifier is a type-level construct and is fine to use. See Item 14. A

field may be both #private and readonly.

**312 | Chapter 9: Writing and Running Your Code**


**Things to Remember**

- By and large, you can convert TypeScript to JavaScript by removing all the types
    from your code.
- Enums, parameter properties, triple-slash imports, experimental decorators, and
    member visibility modifiers are historical exceptions to this rule.
- To keep TypeScript’s role in your codebase as clear as possible and to avoid future
    compatibility issues, avoid nonstandard features.

### Item 73: Use Source Maps to Debug TypeScript

When you run TypeScript code, you’re actually running the JavaScript that the Type‐

Script compiler generates. This is true of any source-to-source compiler, be it a mini‐

fier, a compiler, or a preprocessor. The hope is that this is mostly transparent, that you

can pretend that the TypeScript source code is being executed without ever having to

look at the JavaScript.

This works well until you have to debug your code. Debuggers generally work on the

code you’re executing and don’t know about the translation process it went through.

Since JavaScript is such a popular target language, browser vendors collaborated to

solve this problem. The result is source maps. They map positions and symbols in a

generated file back to the corresponding positions and symbols in the original source.

Most browsers and many IDEs support them. If you’re not using them to debug your

TypeScript, you’re missing out!

Suppose you’ve created a small script to add a button to an HTML page that incre‐

ments every time you click it:

```
// index.ts
function addCounter(el: HTMLElement) {
let clickCount = 0;
const button = document.createElement('button');
button.textContent = 'Click me';
button.addEventListener('click', () => {
clickCount++;
button.textContent = `Click me (${clickCount})`;
});
el.appendChild(button);
}
```
```
addCounter(document.body);
```
If you load this in your browser and open the debugger, you’ll see the generated Java‐

Script (here we’re using a target of ES5). This closely matches the original source, so

debugging isn’t too difficult, as you can see in Figure 9-2.

```
Item 73: Use Source Maps to Debug TypeScript | 313
```

Figure 9-2. Debugging generated JavaScript using Chrome’s developer tools. For this sim‐

ple example, the generated JavaScript closely resembles the TypeScript source.

Let’s make the page more fun by fetching an interesting fact about each number from

numbersapi.com:

```
// index.ts
function addCounter(el: HTMLElement) {
let clickCount = 0;
const triviaEl = document.createElement('p');
const button = document.createElement('button');
button.textContent = 'Click me';
button.addEventListener('click', async () => {
clickCount++;
const response = await fetch(`http://numbersapi.com/${clickCount}`);
const trivia = await response.text();
triviaEl.textContent = trivia;
button.textContent = `Click me (${clickCount})`;
});
el.appendChild(triviaEl);
el.appendChild(button);
}
```
If you click the button several times quickly, you may discover a race condition! If

you open up your browser’s debugger to investigate now, you’ll see that the generated

source has gotten dramatically more complicated (see Figure 9-3).

**314 | Chapter 9: Writing and Running Your Code**


Figure 9-3. The TypeScript compiler has generated JavaScript that doesn’t closely resem‐

ble the original TypeScript source. This will make debugging more difficult.

To support async and await in older browsers, TypeScript has rewritten the event

handler as a state machine. This has the same behavior, but the code no longer bears

such a close resemblance to the original source. This is where source maps can help.

To tell TypeScript to generate one, set the sourceMap option in your tsconfig.json:

```
{
"compilerOptions" : {
"sourceMap" : true
}
}
```
Now when you run tsc, it generates two output files for each .ts file: a .js file and

a .js.map file. The latter is the source map. With this file in place, a new index.ts file

appears in your browser’s debugger. You can set breakpoints and inspect variables in

it, just as you’d hope (see Figure 9-4).

```
Item 73: Use Source Maps to Debug TypeScript | 315
```

Figure 9-4. When a source map is present, you can work with the original TypeScript

source in your debugger, rather than the generated JavaScript.

Note that index.ts appears in italics in the file list on the left. This indicates that it isn’t

a “real” file in the sense that the web page included it. Rather, it was included via the

source map. Depending on your settings, index.js.map will contain either a reference

to index.ts (in which case the browser loads it over the network) or an inline copy of

it (in which case no request is needed).

There are a few things to be aware of with source maps:

- If you are using a bundler or minifier with TypeScript, it may generate a source
    map of its own. To get the best debugging experience, you want this to map all
    the way back to the original TypeScript sources, not the generated JavaScript. If
    your bundler has built-in support for TypeScript, then this should just work. If
    not, you may need to hunt down some flags to make it read source map inputs.
- Be aware of whether you’re serving source maps in production. If your JS file has
    a reference to the source map, then the browser will only load it when the debug‐
    ger is open, so there’s no performance impact for end users. (Inline source maps
    are always downloaded, so you should avoid them in production.) If your source
    map contains a copy of your original source code, then there may be content that
    you didn’t intend to publicize. Does the world really need to see your snarky
    comments or internal bug tracker URLs?

**316 | Chapter 9: Writing and Running Your Code**


You can also debug Node.js programs using source maps. This is typically done via

your editor or by connecting to your Node process from a browser’s debugger. Here’s

some code written in TypeScript that’s intended to be run in Node.js:

```
// bedtime.ts
async function sleep(ms: number ) {
return new Promise< void >(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms));
}
```
```
async function main() {
console.log('Good night!');
await sleep(1000);
console.log('Morning already!?');
}
```
```
main();
```
(The void in Promise<void> indicates that sleep doesn’t resolve to a usable value,

similar to returning void from a function.)

To debug this, compile it to JavaScript with sourceMap set in your tsconfig.json. Then

run it with node using the --inspect-brk flag:

```
$ tsc bedtime.ts
$ node --inspect-brk bedtime.js
Debugger listening on ws://127.0.0.1:9229/587c380b-fdb4-48df-8c09-a83f36d8a2e7
For help, see: https://nodejs.org/en/docs/inspector
```
Now you can open your browser to debug. In Chrome, for example, you navigate to

chrome://inspect. You should see a remote target that you can “Inspect,” as shown in

Figure 9-5.

Figure 9-5. Selecting a remote debug target to inspect in Google Chrome (chrome://

inspect).

Once you connect, you’ll see the usual browser dev tools with the generated Java‐

Script, as shown in Figure 9-6 (here we’re using a target of ES2015).

```
Item 73: Use Source Maps to Debug TypeScript | 317
```

Figure 9-6. Generated JavaScript for a Node.js program in Google Chrome Devtools.

Note the source map reference at the bottom.

In addition to opening a websocket running the remote debugging protocol, the

--inspect-brk flag pauses execution of your code at the very beginning. This is con‐

venient for switching over to the TypeScript view and setting up breakpoints in the

original source, as shown in Figure 9-7.

Figure 9-7. Debugging the original TypeScript source for a Node.js program.

**318 | Chapter 9: Writing and Running Your Code**


JavaScript’s debugger statement is another convenient way to set a breakpoint exactly

where you want.

If you generate .d.ts files for your project (by setting the declaration option), Type‐

Script can also generate .d.ts.map files that map your type declarations back to the

original source. You enable this by setting declarationMap. This can be useful for

improving languages services like “Go to Definition” in your editor, particularly if

you’re using project references (Item 78).

The type checker can catch many errors before you run your code, but it is no substi‐

tute for a good debugger. Use source maps to get a great TypeScript debugging

experience.

**Things to Remember**

- Don’t debug generated JavaScript. Use source maps to debug your TypeScript
    code at runtime.
- Make sure that your source maps are mapped all the way through to the code that
    you run.
- Know how to debug Node.js code written in TypeScript.
- Depending on your settings, your source maps might contain an inline copy of
    your original code. Don’t publish them unless you know what you’re doing!

### Item 74: Know How to Reconstruct Types at Runtime

At some point in the process of learning TypeScript, most developers have an epiph‐

any when they realize that TypeScript types aren’t “real”: they’re erased at runtime

(Item 3). This might be accompanied by a feeling of dread: if the types aren’t real, how

can you trust them?

The independence of types from runtime behavior is a key part of the relationship

between TypeScript and JavaScript (Item 1). And most of the time this system works

very well. But there are undeniably times when it would be extremely convenient to

have access to TypeScript types at runtime. This item explores how this situation

might arise and what your options are.

Imagine you’re implementing a web server and you define an API endpoint for creat‐

ing a comment on a blog post (we saw this API before in Item 42). You define a Type‐

Script type for the request body:

```
interface CreateComment {
postId: string ;
title: string ;
body: string ;
}
```
```
Item 74: Know How to Reconstruct Types at Runtime | 319
```

Your request handler should validate the request. Some of this validation will be at the

application level (does postId reference a post that exists and that the user can com‐

ment on?), but some will be at the type level (does the request have all the properties

we expect, are they of the right type, and are there any extra properties?).

Here’s what that might look like:

```
app.post('/comment', (request, response) => {
const {body} = request;
if (
!body ||
typeof body !== 'object' ||
Object.keys(body).length !== 3 ||
!('postId' in body) || typeof body.postId !== 'string' ||
!('title' in body) || typeof body.title !== 'string' ||
!('body' in body) || typeof body.body !== 'string'
) {
return response.status(400).send('Invalid request');
}
const comment = body as CreateComment;
// ... application validation and logic ...
return response.status(200).send('ok');
});
```
This is already a lot of validation code, even with just three properties. Worse, there’s

nothing to ensure that the checks are accurate and in sync with our type. Nothing

checks that we spelled the properties correctly. And if we add a new property, we’ll

need to remember to add a check, too.

This is code duplication at its worst. We have two things (a type and validation logic)

that need to stay in sync. It would be better if there was a single source of truth. The

interface seems like the natural source of truth, but it’s erased at runtime so it’s

unclear how you’d use it in this way.

Let’s look at a few possible solutions to this conundrum.

**Generate the Types from Another Source**

If your API is specified in some other form, perhaps using GraphQL or an OpenAPI

schema, then you can use that as the source of truth and generate your TypeScript

types from it.

This typically involves running an external tool to generate types and, possibly, vali‐

dation code. An OpenAPI spec uses JSON Schema, for example, so you can use a tool

like json-schema-to-typescript to generate the TypeScript types, and a JSON

Schema validator such as Ajv to validate requests.

The downside of this approach is that it adds some complexity and a build step that

must be run whenever your API schema changes. But if you’re already specifying

**320 | Chapter 9: Writing and Running Your Code**


your API using OpenAPI or some other system, then this has the enormous advan‐

tage of not introducing any new sources of truth, and this is the approach that you

should prefer.

If this is a good fit for your situation, then Item 42 includes an example of generating

TypeScript types from a schema.

**Define Types with a Runtime Library**

TypeScript’s design makes it impossible to derive runtime values from static types.

But going the other direction (from a runtime value to a static type) is straightfor‐

ward using the type-level typeof operator:

```
const val = { postId: '123', title: 'First', body: 'That is all'};
type ValType = typeof val;
// ^? type ValType = { postId: string; title: string; body: string; }
```
So one option is to define your types using runtime constructs and derive the static

types from those. This is typically done using a library. There are many of these, but

at the moment the most popular is Zod (React’s PropTypes is another example).

Here’s how the request validation logic would look with Zod:

```
import { z } from 'zod';
```
```
// runtime value for type validation
const createCommentSchema = z.object({
postId: z. string (),
title: z. string (),
body: z. string (),
});
```
```
// static type
type CreateComment = z. infer < typeof createCommentSchema>;
// ^? type CreateComment = { postId: string; title: string; body: string; }
```
```
app.post('/comment', (request, response) => {
const {body} = request;
try {
const comment = createCommentSchema.parse(body);
// ^? const comment: { postId: string; title: string; body: string; }
// ... application validation and logic ...
return response.status(200).send('ok');
} catch (e) {
return response.status(400).send('Invalid request');
}
});
```
Zod has completely eliminated the duplication: the value createCommentSchema is

now the source of truth, and both the static type CreateComment and the schema vali‐

dation (createCommentSchema.parse) are derived from that.

```
Item 74: Know How to Reconstruct Types at Runtime | 321
```

Zod and the other runtime type libraries are quite effective at solving this problem. So

what are the downsides to using them?

- You now have two ways to define types: Zod’s syntax (z.object) and TypeScript’s
    (interface). While these systems have many similarities, they’re not exactly the
    same. You’re already using TypeScript, so presumably your team has committed
    to learning how to define types using it. Now everyone needs to learn to use Zod
    as well.
- Runtime type systems tend to be contagious: if createCommentSchema needs to
    reference another type, then that type will also need to be reworked into a run‐
    time type. This may make it hard to interoperate with other sources of types, for
    example, if you wanted to reference a type from an external library or generate
    some types from your database (Item 58).

Having a distinct runtime type validation system comes with a few other advantages,

too:

- Libraries like Zod can express many constraints that are hard to capture with
    TypeScript types, for example, “a valid email address” or “an integer.” If you don’t
    use a tool like Zod, you’ll have to write this sort of validation yourself.
- There’s no additional build step. Everything is done through TypeScript. If you
    expect your schema to change frequently, then this will eliminate a failure mode
    and tighten your iteration cycle.

**Generate Runtime Values from Your Types**

If you’re willing to introduce a new tool and build step, then there’s another possibil‐

ity: you can reverse the approach from the previous section and generate a runtime

value from your TypeScript type. JSON Schema is a popular target.

To make this work we’ll put our API types in an api.ts file:

```
// api.ts
export interface CreateComment {
postId: string ;
title: string ;
body: string ;
}
```
then we can run typescript-json-schema to generate JSON Schema for this type:

```
$ npx typescript-json-schema api.ts '*' > api.schema.json
```
Here’s what that file looks like:

```
{
"$schema" : "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
"definitions" : {
```
**322 | Chapter 9: Writing and Running Your Code**


```
"CreateComment" : {
"type" : "object",
"properties" : {
"body" : { "type" : "string" },
"postId" : { "type" : "string" },
"title" : { "type" : "string" }
}
}
}
}
```
Now we can load api.schema.json at runtime. If you enable TypeScript’s resolveJson

Module option, this can be done with an ordinary import. You can perform validation

using any JSON Schema validation library. Here we use the Ajv library:

```
import Ajv from 'ajv';
```
```
import apiSchema from './api.schema.json';
import {CreateComment} from './api';
```
```
const ajv = new Ajv();
```
```
app.post('/comment', (request, response) => {
const {body} = request;
if (!ajv.validate(apiSchema.definitions.CreateComment, body)) {
return response.status(400).send('Invalid request');
}
const comment = body as CreateComment;
// ... application validation and logic ...
return response.status(200).send('ok');
});
```
The great strength of generating values from your TypeScript types is that you can

continue to use all the TypeScript tools you know and love to define your types. You

don’t need to learn a second way to define types since the JSON Schema is an imple‐

mentation detail. Your API types can reference types from @types or other sources

since they’re just TypeScript types.

The downside is that you’ve introduced a new tool and a new build step. Whenever

you change api.ts, you’ll need to regenerate api.schema.json. In practice, you’d want to

enforce that these stay in sync using your continuous integration system.

While you don’t typically need to access TypeScript types at runtime, there are occa‐

sionally situations like input validation where it’s extremely useful. We’ve seen three

approaches to this problem. So which one should you choose?

Unfortunately, there’s no perfect answer. Each option is a trade-off. If your types are

already expressed in some other form, like an OpenAPI schema, then use that as the

source of truth for both your types and your validation logic. This will incur some

tooling and process overhead, but it’s worth it to have a single source of truth.

```
Item 74: Know How to Reconstruct Types at Runtime | 323
```

If not, then the decision is trickier. Would you rather introduce a build step or a sec‐

ond way to define types? If you need to reference types that are only defined using

TypeScript types (perhaps they’re coming from a library or are generated), then gen‐

erating JSON Schema from your TypeScript types is the best option. Otherwise, you

need to pick your poison!

**Things to Remember**

- TypeScript types are erased before your code is run. You can’t access them at run‐
    time without additional tooling.
- Know your options for runtime types: using a distinct runtime type system (such
    as Zod), generating TypeScript types from values (json-schema-to-typescript),
    and generating values from your TypeScript types (typescript-json-schema).
- If you have another specification for your types (e.g., a schema), use that as the
    source of truth.
- If you need to reference external TypeScript types, use typescript-json-schema
    or an equivalent.
- Otherwise, weigh whether you prefer another build step or another system for
    specifying types.

### Item 75: Understand the DOM Hierarchy

Most of the items in this book are agnostic about where you run your TypeScript: in a

web browser, on a server, or on a phone. This one is different. If you’re not working

in a browser, skip ahead to Item 76!

The DOM hierarchy is always present when you’re running JavaScript in a web

browser. When you use document.getElementById to get an element, or

document.createElement to create one, it’s always a particular kind of element, even

if you’re not entirely familiar with the taxonomy. You call the methods and use the

properties that you want and hope for the best.

With TypeScript, the hierarchy of DOM elements becomes more visible. Knowing

your Nodes from your Elements and EventTargets will help you debug type errors

and decide when type assertions are appropriate. Because so many APIs are based on

the DOM, this is relevant even if you’re using a framework like React or D3.

Suppose you want to track a user’s mouse as they drag it across a <div>. You write

some seemingly innocuous JavaScript:

```
function handleDrag(eDown) {
const targetEl = eDown.currentTarget;
targetEl.classList.add('dragging');
const dragStart = [eDown.clientX, eDown.clientY];
```
**324 | Chapter 9: Writing and Running Your Code**


```
const handleUp = (eUp) => {
targetEl.classList.remove('dragging');
targetEl.removeEventListener('mouseup', handleUp);
const dragEnd = [eUp.clientX, eUp.clientY];
console.log('dx, dy = ', [0, 1].map(i => dragEnd[i] - dragStart[i]));
}
targetEl.addEventListener('mouseup', handleUp);
}
const surfaceEl = document.getElementById('surface');
surfaceEl.addEventListener('mousedown', handleDrag);
```
When you add type annotations and run the type checker, it flags no fewer than 11

errors in these 14 lines of code:

```
function handleDrag(eDown: Event) {
const targetEl = eDown.currentTarget;
targetEl.classList.add('dragging');
// ~~~~~ 'targetEl' is possibly 'null'
// ~~~~~~~~~ Property 'classList' does not exist on type 'EventTarget'
const dragStart = [
eDown.clientX, eDown.clientY
// ~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~ Property '...' does not exist on 'Event'
];
const handleUp = (eUp: Event) => {
targetEl.classList.remove('dragging');
// ~~~~~ 'targetEl' is possibly 'null'
// ~~~~~~~~~ Property 'classList' does not exist on type 'EventTarget'
targetEl.removeEventListener('mouseup', handleUp);
// ~~~~~ 'targetEl' is possibly 'null'
const dragEnd = [
eUp.clientX, eUp.clientY
// ~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~ Property '...' does not exist on 'Event'
];
console.log('dx, dy = ', [0, 1].map(i => dragEnd[i] - dragStart[i]));
}
targetEl.addEventListener('mouseup', handleUp);
// ~~~~~ 'targetEl' is possibly 'null'
}
```
```
const surfaceEl = document.getElementById('surface');
surfaceEl.addEventListener('mousedown', handleDrag);
// ~~~~~~ 'surfaceEl' is possibly 'null'
```
What went wrong? What’s this EventTarget? And why might everything be null?

To understand the EventTarget errors, it helps to dig into the DOM hierarchy a bit.

Here’s some HTML:

```
< p id="quote">and < i >yet</ i > it moves</ p >
```
If you open your browser’s JavaScript console and get a reference to the p element,

you’ll see that it’s an HTMLParagraphElement:

```
Item 75: Understand the DOM Hierarchy | 325
```

```
const p = document.getElementsByTagName('p')[0];
p instanceof HTMLParagraphElement
// true
```
An HTMLParagraphElement is a subtype of HTMLElement, which is a subtype of

Element, which is a subtype of Node, which is a subtype of EventTarget. Note that

these are all JavaScript runtime values, not just TypeScript types. Table 9-1 lists some

examples of types along the hierarchy.

Table 9-1. Types in the DOM hierarchy

```
Type Examples
EventTarget window, XMLHttpRequest
Node document, Text, Comment
Element HTMLElements, SVGElements
HTMLElement <i>, <b>
HTMLButtonElement <button>
```
An EventTarget is the most general of all DOM types. All you can do with it is add

event listeners, remove them, and dispatch events. With this in mind, the classList

errors start to make a bit more sense:

```
function handleDrag(eDown: Event) {
const targetEl = eDown.currentTarget;
targetEl.classList.add('dragging');
// ~~~~~ 'targetEl' is possibly 'null'
// ~~~~~~~~~ Property 'classList' does not exist on type 'EventTarget'
// ...
}
```
As its name implies, an Event’s currentTarget property is an EventTarget. It could

even be null. TypeScript has no reason to believe that it has a classList property.

While currentTarget may be an HTMLElement in practice, from the type system’s per‐

spective there’s no reason it couldn’t be window or an XMLHttpRequest. (current

Target is the element you registered the listener on, while target is the element

where the event originated, which could have a different type.)

Moving up the hierarchy we come to Node. Nodes that are not Elements include text

fragments and comments. For instance, in this HTML:

```
< p >
And < i >yet</ i > it moves
<!-- quote from Galileo -->
</ p >
```
the outermost element is an HTMLParagraphElement. As you can see here, it has

children and childNodes:

**326 | Chapter 9: Writing and Running Your Code**


```
> p.children
HTMLCollection [i]
> p.childNodes
NodeList(5) [text, i, text, comment, text]
```
children returns an HTMLCollection, an array-like structure containing just the

child Elements (<i>yet</i>). childNodes returns a NodeList, an array-like collec‐

tion of Nodes. This includes not just Elements (<i>yet</i>) but also text fragments

(“And,” “it moves”) and comments (“quote from Galileo”). (See Item 17 for a refresher

on what “array-like” means.) You can use array spread syntax ([...p.childNodes])

to get a true array if you need one.

What’s the difference between an Element and an HTMLElement? There are non-

HTML Elements including the whole hierarchy of SVG tags. These are SVGElements,

which are another type of Element. What’s the type of an <html> or <svg> tag?

They’re HTMLHtmlElement and SVGSVGElement. If you don’t use SVG or MathML

then, in practice, all your Elements will be HTMLElements.

Sometimes specialized Element classes will have properties of their own—for exam‐

ple, an HTMLImageElement has a src property, and an HTMLInputElement has a value

property. If you want to read one of these properties off a value, its type must be spe‐

cific enough to have that property.

TypeScript’s type declarations for the DOM make liberal use of literal types to try to

get you the most specific type possible. For example:

```
const p = document.getElementsByTagName('p')[0];
// ^? const p: HTMLParagraphElement
const button = document.createElement('button');
// ^? const button: HTMLButtonElement
const div = document.querySelector('div');
// ^? const div: HTMLDivElement | null
```
But this is not always possible, notably with document.getElementById:

```
const div = document.getElementById('my-div');
// ^? const div: HTMLElement | null
```
While type assertions are generally frowned upon (Item 9 explains why), this is a case

where you know more than TypeScript does and so they are appropriate. There’s

nothing wrong with this assertion, so long as you know that #my-div is a div:

```
document.getElementById('my-div') as HTMLDivElement;
```
A runtime check will do the trick if you don’t know:

```
const div = document.getElementById('my-div');
if (div instanceof HTMLDivElement) {
console.log(div);
// ^? const div: HTMLDivElement
}
```
```
Item 75: Understand the DOM Hierarchy | 327
```

(Item 54 explores another way to get more precise types for HTMLElements.)

With strictNullChecks enabled, you’ll need to consider the case that

document.getElementById returns null. Depending on whether this can really hap‐

pen, you can either add an if statement or a non-null assertion (!):

```
const div = document.getElementById('my-div')!;
// ^? const div: HTMLElement
```
These types are not specific to TypeScript. Rather, they are generated from the formal

specification of the DOM. This is an example of the advice of Item 42 to generate

types from specs when possible.

So much for the DOM hierarchy. What about the clientX and clientY errors?

```
function handleDrag(eDown: Event) {
// ...
const dragStart = [
eDown.clientX, eDown.clientY
// ~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~ Property '...' does not exist on 'Event'
];
// ...
}
```
In addition to the hierarchy for Nodes and Elements, there is also a hierarchy for

Events. TypeScript’s lib.dom.d.ts defines no fewer than 54 subtypes of Event!

Plain Event is the most generic type of event. More specific types include:

UIEvent

Any sort of user interface event

MouseEvent

An event triggered by the mouse, such as a click

TouchEvent

A touch event on a mobile device

KeyboardEvent

A key press

The problem in handleDrag is that the events are declared as Event, while clientX

and clientY exist only on the more specific MouseEvent type.

So how can you fix the example from the start of this item? Item 24 explained how

TypeScript makes use of context to infer more precise types, and the DOM declara‐

tions make extensive use of this. Inlining the mousedown handler gives TypeScript

more context and removes most of the errors. You can also declare the parameter

type to be MouseEvent rather than Event.

**328 | Chapter 9: Writing and Running Your Code**


Here’s a complete version of the code sample from the start of this item that passes

the type checker:

```
function addDragHandler(el: HTMLElement) {
el.addEventListener('mousedown', eDown => {
const dragStart = [eDown.clientX, eDown.clientY];
const handleUp = (eUp: MouseEvent) => {
el.classList.remove('dragging');
el.removeEventListener('mouseup', handleUp);
const dragEnd = [eUp.clientX, eUp.clientY];
console.log('dx, dy = ', [0, 1].map(i => dragEnd[i] - dragStart[i]));
}
el.addEventListener('mouseup', handleUp);
});
}
```
```
const surfaceEl = document.getElementById('surface');
if (surfaceEl) {
addDragHandler(surfaceEl);
}
```
The if statement at the end handles the possibility that there is no #surface element.

If you know that this element exists, you could use a non-null assertion instead

(surfaceEl!). addDragHandler requires a non-null HTMLElement, following Item 33’s

advice to push null values to the perimeter.

**Things to Remember**

- The DOM has a type hierarchy that you can usually ignore while writing Java‐
    Script. But these types become more important in TypeScript. Understanding
    them will help you write TypeScript for the browser.
- Know the differences between Node, Element, HTMLElement, and EventTarget, as
    well as those between Event and MouseEvent.
- Either use a specific enough type for DOM elements and Events in your code or
    give TypeScript the context to infer it.

### Item 76: Create an Accurate Model of Your Environment

As Item 3 explained, your TypeScript code will eventually get converted to JavaScript

and executed. More specifically, it will be executed by a particular runtime (V8,

JavaScriptCore, SpiderMonkey) in a particular environment (a web page in a browser,

a test runner in Node.js, Deno, Electron, etc.).

For TypeScript to statically model the runtime behavior of your code, it needs a

model of that environment. One of your main goals in configuring a TypeScript

project is to ensure that this model is as accurate as possible. The more accurately you

```
Item 76: Create an Accurate Model of Your Environment | 329
```

model your runtime environment, the more effective TypeScript will be at finding

errors in your code.

For example, your generated JavaScript might run in a browser where it’s included in

an HTML page:

```
< script src="path/to/bundle.js"></ script >
```
TypeScript gives you a few ways to model this. One is via the lib setting in your

tsconfig.json:

```
{
"compilerOptions" : {
"lib" : ["dom", "es2021"]
}
}
```
By including "dom" in "lib", we tell TypeScript that it should include type declara‐

tions for a browser. The "es2021" indicates that we expect the browser to have built-

in support for everything in the JavaScript standard from that year (either natively or

via a polyfill). Using a feature from a newer version (for example, array.toSorted())

will result in a type error. You may not know precisely which features are in each

ECMAScript version, but TypeScript does. By creating an accurate model of your

environment, it can help you catch this particular mistake.

You can also model the types available in a web browser by installing the @types/web

package, which gives you a bit more control over versioning. Item 75 has much more

to say about TypeScript and the DOM.

It’s likely that your script tag isn’t the only one on your page. Perhaps your HTML

actually looks like this:

```
< script type="text/javascript">
window.userInfo = { name: 'Jane Doe', accountId: '123-abc' };
</ script >
< script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.7.1.min.js"></ script >
< script type="text/javascript">
// ... load Google Analytics ...
</ script >
< script src="path/to/bundle.js"></ script >
```
Each of those <script> tags modifies the environment in some way, adding global

variables that are available to your code. To ensure accurate type checking, you’ll need

to tell TypeScript about them.

You can model the userInfo global with a type declaration file:

```
// user-info-global.d.ts
interface UserInfo {
name: string ;
accountId: string ;
```
**330 | Chapter 9: Writing and Running Your Code**


##### }

```
declare global {
interface Window {
userInfo: UserInfo;
}
}
```
See Item 47 for more on more on the Window syntax here.

You can model the libraries by installing their type declarations:

```
$ npm install --save-dev @types/google.analytics @types/jquery
```
To get an accurate model, it’s essential that the @types package models the version of

the library that you source on your page. See Item 66 for more on how to match these

up. If you get this wrong, TypeScript may report spurious errors or miss some real

ones.

Perhaps you’re bundling your code using webpack, which lets you import CSS and

image files directly from JavaScript. These files are part of the environment, but Type‐

Script doesn’t know about them and will complain:

```
import sunrisePath from './images/beautiful-sunrise.jpg';
// ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
// Cannot find module './images/beautiful-sunrise.jpg' or its type declarations.
```
To make this work, you need to model these types of imports:

```
// webpack-imports.d.ts
declare module '*.jpg' {
const src: string ;
export default src;
}
```
webpack actually lets you import specific CSS rules from CSS modules. If you use this

feature, you’ll need to either add it to your model or install one of the npm packages

that does this for you.

It’s possible that different parts of your application run in different environments. For

example, your app might have client code that runs in a browser and server code that

runs under Node.js, not to mention test code that runs in its own environment. Since

these are distinct environments, you’ll want to model them separately. The usual way

to do this is with multiple tsconfig.json files and project references, which are dis‐

cussed in Item 78.

As with the browser, make sure you model the Node.js environment accurately. If you

run your code using Node.js version 20, make sure you install that version of @types/

node. This will ensure that you only use the library features that are available to you at

runtime.

```
Item 76: Create an Accurate Model of Your Environment | 331
```

**Things to Remember**

- Your code runs in a particular environment. TypeScript will do a better job of
    checking your code if you create an accurate static model of that environment.
- Model global variables and libraries that are loaded onto a web page along with
    your code.
- Match versions between type declarations and the libraries and runtime environ‐
    ment that you use.
- Use multiple tsconfig.json files and project references to model distinct environ‐
    ments within a single project (for example client and server).

#### Item 77: Understand the Relationship Between

#### Type Checking and Unit Testing

You sometimes hear claims that adopting TypeScript lets you delete most of your unit

tests. Or, flipping the argument around, that there’s no point in adding types to your

code since you’ll still need to write unit tests.

These are both extreme positions, but there is an interesting distinction hiding

behind the bluster. Unit tests and type checking are both forms of program verifica‐

tion. So what’s the relationship between the two? When should you write tests, and

when should you rely on types?

Let’s consider a function that adds two numbers:

```
/** Returns the sum of the two numbers. */
function add(a, b) {
// implementation omitted
}
```
If this seems too simple to test, then take a quick look at the IEEE 754 floating point

spec. There are quite a few corner cases! Here’s what a unit test might look like:

```
test('add', () => {
expect(add(0, 0)).toEqual(0);
expect(add(123, 456)).toEqual(579);
expect(add(-100, 90)).toEqual(-10);
});
```
Assuming these tests pass, how confident should we be in the correctness of the add

function? There are an enormous number of possible inputs. Numbers in JavaScript

are 64-bit floats, so there are 2^64 possible values for each parameter, or 2^128 possible

inputs in total. That’s an enormous number: it starts with 3 and is followed by

38 more digits. Our three test cases only cover an infinitesimal fraction of the

possibilities.

**332 | Chapter 9: Writing and Running Your Code**


These gaps create space for bugs to creep in. For example, what if this were the

implementation?

```
function add(a, b) {
if (isNaN(a) || isNaN(b)) {
return 'Not a number!';
}
return (a|0) + (b|0);
}
```
This passes our unit test. But the behavior with NaN values is surprising and probably

misguided (it should certainly be called out in the documentation!). The effect of the

bitwise operations is to round the inputs toward zero before adding them. Presuma‐

bly, the function should add nonintegers, too. Unless we specifically wrote unit tests

for these cases, we wouldn’t be able to catch these bugs.

Now let’s see what happens if you add types:

```
function add(a: number , b: number ): number {
if (isNaN(a) || isNaN(b)) {
return 'Not a number!';
// ~~~ Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.
}
return (a|0) + (b|0);
}
```
Thanks to our type annotations, TypeScript has been able to spot one of the bugs.

There are whole classes of implementation errors that it can prevent: returning the

wrong type or performing invalid operations on the inputs. You could write a unit

test to check that add returns a number, but you’d never be able to test this for all 2^128

possible inputs. TypeScript has.

Of course, there are many mistakes that the type checker can’t catch. It doesn’t catch

the issue with decimals versus integers. In fact, here’s another implementation that

passes the type checker but is clearly wrong:

```
function add(a: number , b: number ): number {
return a - b; // oops!
}
```
Any unit test where b is non-zero would catch this bug, but the type checker is blind

to it.

Unit tests and type checking are complementary processes. Unit tests demonstrate

that your code behaves correctly in at least some situations. In other words, they pro‐

vide a lower bound on correctness. A type checker can prove that you haven’t made a

particular class of errors, say returning the wrong type. It provides an upper bound

on incorrectness. You can think of the two processes as whittling away at the bugs

from both ends until you’re satisfied that your code works well enough.

```
Item 77: Understand the Relationship Between Type Checking and Unit Testing | 333
```

Regardless of what the documentation or types say, in JavaScript, functions can be

called with any type of argument. In addition to adding numbers, the simple version

of the add function (return a+b) has the following behavior:

```
> add(null, null)
0
> add(null, 12)
12
> add(undefined, null)
NaN
> add('ab', 'cd')
'abcd'
```
Should you test these behaviors? TypeScript is unhappy if you do:

```
test('out-of-domain add', () => {
expect(add( null , null )).toEqual(0);
// ~~~~ Type 'null' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.
expect(add( null , 12)).toEqual(12);
// ~~~~ Type 'null' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.
expect(add( undefined , null )).toBe( NaN );
// ~~~~~~~~~ Type 'undefined' is not assignable to parameter of ...
expect(add('ab', 'cd')).toEqual('abcd');
// ~~~~ Type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.
});
```
This makes sense. Unit tests are about demonstrating expected behavior. For invalid

inputs, there is no expected behavior to demonstrate. You should rely on the type

checker to prevent these invalid calls. There’s no need to write these sorts of unit tests.

There’s an important caveat to this for functions that have potentially harmful side

effects. Imagine you have a function that updates a user record in a database:

```
interface User {
id: string ;
name: string ;
memberSince: string ;
}
```
```
declare function updateUserById(
id: string ,
update: Partial<Omit<User, 'id'>> & {id?: never }
): Promise<User>;
```
The intention of the elaborate type on the update parameter is that this function

really shouldn’t be used to change a user’s ID. (Item 63 explains the “optional never”

trick.) Doing so might cause a collision or even a security issue if it allows one user to

impersonate another. But this is only enforced at the type level. If you call this func‐

tion from JavaScript, perhaps even with untrusted user input, then it’s entirely possi‐

ble that the update argument will have an id property. It would be better if the

function threw an exception (i.e., rejected) rather than corrupting the database.

**334 | Chapter 9: Writing and Running Your Code**


This is a good behavior to specify and test, even if it’s disallowed by the types. You can

use an @ts-expect-error directive in your test to assert that it’s a type error:

```
test('invalid update', () => {
// @ts-expect-error Can't call updateUserById to update an ID.
expect(() => updateUserById('123', {id: '234'})).toReject();
});
```
One of the main goals in software quality assurance (QA) is to find problems as soon

as possible, when the cost of fixing them is low. The worst way to learn about a bug is

to have an end user (or a security researcher!) report it when it’s already in produc‐

tion. Better, but still expensive, is to catch it as part of a manual QA process. Better

yet is an automated QA process, say an integration test. Unit tests catch bugs even

earlier and more quickly. But type checking is the most immediate of all, reporting

bugs right in your editor, hopefully in the exact place that you made a mistake.

To catch bugs as quickly as possible, you should rely on the type checker where you

can. TypeScript can catch many errors, but sometimes it requires a bit of help. Items

59 , 61, and 64 all present techniques for helping the type checker catch new classes of

errors. But when you can’t rely on type checking, namely for testing behaviors, unit

tests are the next best option.

If your types themselves contain logic (Chapter 6 is all about this), then you abso‐

lutely need to write tests for them. Type tests are a different sort of test than unit tests.

Item 55 explores the fascinating world of type testing.

Finally, while both types and unit tests will help catch bugs when you refactor, types

also power the language services that make programming a more enjoyable experi‐

ence. As Item 6 explained, they can even do the refactoring for you!

Unit tests and type checking are both forms of program verification, but they work in

different and complementary ways. You typically want both. Keep their respective

roles clear and avoid repeating the same checks with both.

**Things to Remember**

- Type checking and unit testing are different, complementary techniques for dem‐
    onstrating program correctness. You want both.
- Unit tests demonstrate correct behavior on particular inputs, while type checking
    eliminates whole classes of incorrect behaviors.
- Rely on the type checker to check types. Write unit tests for behaviors that can’t
    be checked with types.
- Avoid testing inputs that would be type errors unless there are concerns about
    security or data corruption.

### Item 78: Pay Attention to Compiler Performance

As Item 3 explained, TypeScript types are erased when you compile your code to

JavaScript. So generally speaking, TypeScript has zero impact on the runtime perfor‐

mance of your code.

TypeScript can have an impact on the performance of your developer tooling, how‐

ever. TypeScript comes with two executables, tsc and tsserver (Item 6). It makes

sense to talk about the performance of both of them:

tsc, the TypeScript compiler

```
Slow performance here means that your code will take longer to type check as
part of a batch process (perhaps on your CI system) and will take longer to pro‐
duce build artifacts (.js and .d.ts files).
```
tsserver, the TypeScript Language Service

```
Slow performance here means that your editor might feel sluggish or unrespon‐
sive. It may take a frustratingly long time for errors to appear or disappear after
you change your code.
```
If build or editor performance becomes a problem on your project, there are many

techniques available that might help. This item will look at a few of the most impact‐

ful. For each it will say which type of performance it impacts.

**Separate Type Checking from Building**

This only affects tsc (build) performance, not tsserver (editor).

At a high level, TypeScript does two things: it checks your code for type errors and it

emits JavaScript. The type checking is typically the more CPU intensive of the two. If

you don’t need the type checking, then skipping this step can be a huge time saver.

At first blush, this may sound like a strange thing to do. Isn’t type checking the whole

point of using TypeScript instead of JavaScript? In practice, though, you may be run‐

ning TypeScript indirectly via some other tool, perhaps a bundler (webpack, vite,

etc.) or ts-node. By default, these tools will type check your code and then bundle or

run the generated JavaScript. But they don’t need to do this. You can tell any of them

to run in “transpile only” mode to skip the checking.

This can make a noticeable difference even for trivial programs:

```
// hello.ts
console.log('Hello World!');
```
Here’s how quickly this runs with and without type checking using ts-node:

```
$ time ts-node --transpileOnly hello.ts
Hello World!
```
**336 | Chapter 9: Writing and Running Your Code**


```
ts-node --transpileOnly hello.ts 0.12s user 0.02s system 110% cpu 0.123 total
$ time ts-node hello.ts
Hello World!
ts-node hello.ts 1.60s user 0.08s system 255% cpu 0.656 total
```
This trivial program took 1.6 seconds to run with type checking but only 0.12 sec‐

onds without. If ts-node or a bundler is part of your toolchain, turning off type

checking can significantly tighten your iteration cycle and improve your developer

experience (DX). You may even be able to plug in an alternative TypeScript compiler,

such as swc, to get a bigger speedup.

Of course, type checking is still important! You’ll still get type errors as you develop

code in your editor (via tsserver), and you should make sure to run tsc on your CI

service to make sure you only commit code that passes the type checker.

**Prune Unused Dependencies and Dead Code**

This affects both build and editor performance.

The less code you have, the faster TypeScript can process it. Fewer types and symbols

also means lower RAM usage by tsserver, which will make your editor more

responsive.

One good way to shrink your project is via dead code elimination. If you set the noU

nusedLocals flag, TypeScript will detect some unused code and types:

```
function foo() {}
// ~~~ 'foo' is declared but its value is never read.
```
```
export function bar() {}
```
This works well for un-exported symbols. But an exported symbol might be unused,

too, if it’s never imported anywhere. To detect that, you’ll need a more sophisticated

tool like knip. This will also report unused third-party dependencies (e.g., node mod‐

ules). Removing these can be a huge win since their type declarations may be many

thousands of lines.

In fact, it’s likely that the majority of the types in your project come from third-party

code. You can run tsc --listFiles to get a printout of all the sources that go into

your TypeScript project:

```
$ tsc --listFiles
.../lib/node_modules/typescript/lib/lib.es5.d.ts
.../lib/node_modules/typescript/lib/lib.es2015.d.ts
.../lib/node_modules/typescript/lib/lib.es2016.d.ts
.../lib/node_modules/typescript/lib/lib.es2017.d.ts
...
```
The results may surprise you! Sometimes one dependency can pull in hundreds or

thousands of others (Item 70 describes a way to avoid this). A good way to visualize

```
Item 78: Pay Attention to Compiler Performance | 337
```

this is with a treemap. Since tsc will spend more time on a large file than a small file,

you’ll want to visualize the number of bytes in each file being compiled.

Here’s the magic incantation (the stat syntax may vary depending on your platform):

```
$ tsc --noEmit --listFiles | xargs stat -f "%z %N" | npx webtreemap-cli
```
For one of the author’s projects, the results looked like Figure 9-8.

Figure 9-8. Treemap of the files that TypeScript considers, weighted by file size.

This is a lot of code: nearly 110 MB! And most of it is evidently Google APIs? Many

of these were APIs (compute, dialogflow, dfareporting, healthcare) that my project

did not use. As it turned out, Google bundled all 300+ of its APIs as a single package,

weighing in at an impressive 80.5 MB. My project depended on only one or two APIs,

but this design meant that it still pulled in all three hundred of them.

In this case, updating to a newer version of googleapis fixed the issue since they

added support for depending on just one API. If a dependency is particularly large,

you may want to look into alternatives. You may also notice that you’re pulling in

multiple versions of the same library. The solution is to update versions until your

dependencies align (Item 66).

Regardless of the actions you take, the treemap visualization will make you more

aware of what you’re building and put you on the scent of potential issues. Before

looking at my treemap, I hadn’t thought much about my project’s use of googleapis.

Afterwards, I couldn’t think of much else!

**338 | Chapter 9: Writing and Running Your Code**


**Incremental Builds and Project References**

These only affect build (tsc) performance.

If you run tsc twice in a row, it will repeat all its work on the second invocation. But

if you set the incremental option, it will do something smarter: on the first invoca‐

tion, it will write a .tsbuildinfo file that saves some of the work it’s done. On the

second invocation, it will read that file and use it to check your types more quickly.

TypeScript lets you take this incremental approach a step further with “Project refer‐

ences.” The idea here is that if your code base has distinct parts (say client/server or

source/test), then changes to one should have a limited effect on the other. In particu‐

lar, if you change the implementation of a function in your source (but not its type

signature), then TypeScript shouldn’t have to redo type checking for your tests. And

no change to the tests should require TypeScript to redo type checking for your

source.

To set up project references, you create a tsconfig.json file for each distinct part of

your repo. These files say which other parts of your code they can reference. Your

tests will reference your source, but not the other way around. You also typically have

a top-level tsconfig.json for shared configuration. Here’s what the setup might look

like:

```
root
├── src
│ ├── fib.ts
│ └── tsconfig.json
├── test
│ ├── fib.test.ts
│ └── tsconfig.json
├── tsconfig-base.json
└── tsconfig.json
```
Here’s what these files look like:

```
// tsconfig-base.json
{
"compilerOptions" : {
// other settings
"declaration" : true ,
"composite" : true
}
}
```
```
// tsconfig.json
{
"files" : [],
"references" : [
{ "path" : "./src" },
{ "path" : "./test" }
```
```
Item 78: Pay Attention to Compiler Performance | 339
```

##### ]

##### }

```
// src/tsconfig.json
{
"extends" : "../tsconfig-base.json",
"compilerOptions" : {
"outDir" : "../dist/src",
"rootDir" : "."
}
}
```
```
// src/fib.ts
export function fib(n: number ): number {
if (n < 2) {
return n;
}
return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
}
```
```
// test/tsconfig.json
{
"extends" : "../tsconfig-base.json",
"compilerOptions" : {
"outDir" : "../dist/test",
"rootDir" : "."
},
"references" : [
{ "path" : "../src" }
]
}
```
```
// test/fib.test.ts
import {fib} from '../src/fib';
```
```
describe('fib', () => {
it('should handle base cases', () => {
expect(fib(0)).toEqual(0);
expect(fib(1)).toEqual(1);
})
```
```
it('should handle larger numbers', () => {
expect(fib(2)).toEqual(1);
expect(fib(3)).toEqual(2);
expect(fib(4)).toEqual(3);
expect(fib(5)).toEqual(5);
expect(fib(16)).toEqual(987);
});
});
```
That’s a lot of configuration! Here are the interesting bits:

- The src and test tsconfig.json inherit a shared base configuration that sets
    composite and declaration (to output .d.ts files).

**340 | Chapter 9: Writing and Running Your Code**


- The top-level tsconfig.json consists only of a list of references to subprojects.
- The test tsconfig.json references src but not the other way around.

With this setup in place, you can run tsc with the -b / --build flag to make it act as a

sort of build coordinator. After a first run, if you make a change to src/fib.ts that does

not affect the API, you’ll see something like this:

```
$ tsc -b -v
Project 'src/tsconfig.json' is out of date because output
'dist/src/tsconfig.tsbuildinfo' is older than input 'src/fib.ts'
Building project 'src/tsconfig.json'...
Project 'test/tsconfig.json' is up to date with .d.ts files from its
dependencies
```
The last line is the important one. Our change didn’t affect the .d.ts files (it was an

implementation change, not an API change), so the test project didn’t need to be

rebuilt.

There are a few caveats to be aware of with project references:

- In order for them to be useful, you must have declaration set, so that tsc out‐
    puts .d.ts files on disk. If you use noEmit or run tsc via webpack, vite, or some
    other tool, then project references won’t help you.
- Project references are most useful in large monorepos. The general rule of thumb
    is that they’re helpful primarily if you have more first-party code than third-party
    code (i.e., more lines of your own code than in node modules). This is rarely the
    case for small- to medium-sized projects, but it’s often the case at large
    corporations.
- While creating a small number of projects can speed up your interactions with
    TypeScript, creating too many can do the opposite. Try to scope projects to large
    chunks of your code. Creating distinct projects for src and test, or client and
    server, will be a win on large apps. But creating a separate project for each of
    your thousand UI components will create organizational overhead and is
    unlikely to improve TypeScript performance.

**Simplify Your Types**

This affects both build and editor performance.

Suppose you want to create a type to represent a year. Item 29 encouraged you to craft

types that can only represent valid states, so you craft a type that should hold up for

the rest of the millennium:

```
type Digit = '0' | '1' | '2' | '3' | '4' | '5' | '6' | '7' | '8' | '9';
type Year = `2${Digit}${Digit}${Digit}`;
const validYear: Year = '2024';
```
```
Item 78: Pay Attention to Compiler Performance | 341
```

```
const invalidYear: Year = '1999';
// ~~~~~~~~~~~ Type '"1999"' is not assignable to type
// '"2000" | "2001" | "2002" | ... 996 more ... | "2999"'.
```
While it’s interesting that we can represent this type using TypeScript’s type system, it

may not be wise. The error hints at why: the Year type is a union with a thousand

elements! Every time TypeScript has to do something with this type, it will have to

check all of these. This is likely to make tsc and tsserver sluggish. Better to use

something simpler like a string or a number, or even a branded type (Item 64) if you

want to model this distinctly.

This is an extreme example, but enormous unions do sometimes arise, and you

should be aware that they can be a performance problem. Other ways to make your

types more efficient include:

- Extend interfaces rather than intersecting type aliases. Item 13 goes into great
    detail about the similarities and differences between type and interface. Usually
    they are interchangeable. But for subtyping, TypeScript is able to operate more
    efficiently with extends.
- Annotating return types. Item 18 discusses the pros and cons of adding type
    annotations, but providing explicit annotations on the return type of functions
    can save TypeScript work in inferring the type.

You should be particularly careful if you’re writing complex recursive types. Item 57

goes into more detail about how to keep these from blowing up.

**Things to Remember**

- There are two forms of TypeScript performance issues: build performance (tsc)
    and editor latency (tsserver). Recognize the symptoms of each and direct your
    optimizations accordingly.
- Keep type checking separate from your build process.
- Remove dead code and dependencies, and be on guard for code bloat in type
    dependencies. Use a treemap to visualize what TypeScript is compiling.
- Use incremental builds and project references to reduce the work tsc does
    between builds.
- Simplify your types: avoid large unions, use interface extension rather than
    intersection types, and consider annotating function return types.

### Modernization and Migration

You’ve heard that TypeScript is great. You also know from painful experience that

maintaining your 15-year-old, 100,000-line JavaScript library isn’t. If only it could

become a TypeScript library!

This chapter offers some advice about migrating your JavaScript project to TypeScript

without losing your sanity or abandoning the effort.

The less code you have, the easier it will be to migrate. So it’s a good idea to remove

deprecated features and do a round of dead code elimination before you start a Type‐

Script migration. You may want to hold off on other forms of modernization, how‐

ever: converting a jQuery web app to React will actually be much easier once you’ve

adopted TypeScript.

Only the smallest codebases can be migrated in one fell swoop. The key for larger

projects is to migrate gradually. Item 81 discusses how to do this. For a long migra‐

tion, it’s essential to track your progress and make sure you don’t backslide. This cre‐

ates a sense of momentum and inevitability to the change. Item 82 discusses ways to

do this.

Migrating a large project to TypeScript won’t necessarily be easy, but it does offer a

huge potential upside. A 2017 study found that 15% of bugs fixed in JavaScript

projects on GitHub could have been prevented with TypeScript.^1 Even more impres‐

sive, a survey of 6 months’ worth of postmortems at Airbnb found that 38% of them

could have been prevented by TypeScript.^2 If you’re advocating for TypeScript at your

organization, stats like these will help! So will running some experiments and finding

##### 343


early adopters. Item 80 discusses how to experiment with TypeScript before you

begin migration.

Since this chapter is largely about JavaScript, many of the code samples are either

pure JavaScript (and not expected to pass the type checker) or checked with looser

settings (e.g., with noImplicitAny off ). We’ll make occasional reference to the

author’s dygraphs charting library in this chapter as an example of legacy code in

need of modernization and migration. dygraphs is a venerable old JavaScript library

that saw its most active period of development from 2009–2016.

#### Item 79: Write Modern JavaScript

In addition to checking your code for type safety, TypeScript compiles it to any ver‐

sion of JavaScript, all the way back to 2009 vintage ES5. Since TypeScript is a superset

of the latest version of JavaScript, this means that you can use tsc as a “transpiler”:

something that takes new JavaScript and converts it to older, more widely supported

JavaScript.

Taking a different perspective, this means that when you decide to convert an existing

JavaScript codebase to TypeScript, there’s no downside to adopting all the latest Java‐

Script features. In fact, there’s quite a bit of upside: because TypeScript is designed to

work with modern JavaScript, modernizing your JS is a great first step toward adopt‐

ing TypeScript.

And because TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, learning to write more modern

and idiomatic JavaScript means you’re learning to write better TypeScript, too.

This item presents some of the highlights of modern JavaScript, which I’m defining

here as everything introduced in ES2015 (aka ES6) and after. This material is covered

in much greater detail in other books and online. If any of the topics mentioned here

are unfamiliar, you owe it to yourself to learn more about them. TypeScript can be

tremendously helpful when you’re learning a new language feature like async/await:

it almost certainly understands the feature better than you do and can guide you

toward correct usage.

These features are all worth understanding, but by far the most important for adopt‐

ing TypeScript are ECMAScript modules and ES2015 classes. We’ll look at those first

and then quickly list some of the other highlights. If your project is already using

these features, then count your blessings! Your migration will be much easier.

**Use ECMAScript Modules**

Before the 2015 version of ECMAScript (ES) there was no standard way to break

your code into separate modules. There were many solutions, from multiple

<script> tags, manual concatenation, and Makefiles, to Node.js-style require

**344 | Chapter 10: Modernization and Migration**


statements or AMD-style define callbacks. TypeScript even had its own module sys‐

tem (Item 72).

Today there is one standard: ECMAScript modules, aka import and export. If your

JavaScript codebase is still a single file, if you use concatenation or one of the other

module systems, it’s time to switch to ES modules. This may require setting up a tool

like webpack or ts-node. TypeScript works best with ES modules, and adopting them

will facilitate your transition, not least because it will allow you to migrate modules

one at a time (see Item 82).

The details will vary depending on your setup, but if you’re using CommonJS like

this:

```
// CommonJS
// a.js
const b = require('./b');
console.log(b.name);
```
```
// b.js
const name = 'Module B';
module.exports = {name};
```
then the ES module equivalent would look like:

```
// ECMAScript module
// a.ts
import * as b from './b';
console.log(b.name);
```
```
// b.ts
export const name = 'Module B';
```
You can adopt ES modules in your TypeScript without adopting them in the gener‐

ated JavaScript, which may be a more difficult change. If you set the module option to

"commonjs" in your tsconfig.json, for example, TypeScript would compile the second

code sample to the first one.

**Use Classes Instead of Prototypes**

JavaScript has a flexible prototype-based object model. But by and large, JS develop‐

ers have ignored this in favor of a more rigid class-based model. This was officially

codified in the language with the introduction of the class keyword in ES2015.

If your code uses prototypes in a straightforward way, switch to using classes. That is,

instead of:

```
function Person(first, last) {
this .first = first;
this .last = last;
}
```
```
Item 79: Write Modern JavaScript | 345
```

```
Person.prototype.getName = function () {
return this .first + ' ' + this .last;
}
```
```
const marie = new Person('Marie', 'Curie');
console.log(marie.getName());
```
write:

```
class Person {
constructor(first, last) {
this .first = first;
this .last = last;
}
```
```
getName() {
return this .first + ' ' + this .last;
}
}
```
```
const marie = new Person('Marie', 'Curie');
console.log(marie.getName());
```
TypeScript struggles with the prototype version of Person but understands the class-

based version with minimal annotations. If you’re unfamiliar with the syntax, Type‐

Script will help you get it right.

For code that uses older-style classes, the TypeScript language service offers a “Con‐

vert function to an ES2015 class” quick fix that can speed this up (Figure 10-1).

**Other Features**

Adopting ES2015 modules and classes will have the greatest impact on facilitating

your code’s migration to TypeScript. But there are many other new features of Java‐

Script: a new version comes out every year! Having at least a passing familiarity with

them will help you write more succinct and idiomatic JavaScript, and hence Type‐

Script. If any of the features in this list aren’t familiar to you, do some Googling to

learn more. Even just knowing the name of the feature can be helpful.

- Use let and const instead of var to declare variables. The reason is that var has
    some quirky scoping rules. If you’re curious to learn more about them, read
    Effective JavaScript. But better to avoid var and not worry!
- Use for-of or array methods like map instead of C-style for(;;) loops. The
    three-part C-style for loop introduces an index variable that you may not other‐
    wise need, is easier to get wrong, and doesn’t adapt as well to iterators (as
    described in Item 17). See Item 60 for more on how to iterate over objects in
    TypeScript.
- Use async and await for asynchronous functions instead of callbacks or raw
    Promises. This is covered in detail in Item 27.
- Prefer arrow functions to function expressions because they’re more concise and
    they preserve the this value from their surrounding context. Item 69 explains
    this binding.
- Use default parameter values. Traditionally you’d set default values on function
    parameters in the implementation, but in modern JavaScript you can put the
    default value directly in the declaration (function foo(param=123) {}). In
    TypeScript this has the added advantage that it allows the parameter’s type to be
    inferred from the default value.
- Use compact object literals and destructuring assignment. Rather than writing
    {x: x}, you can just write {x}. This encourages consistent naming of variables.
    Conversely you can write [x, y] = pair to unpack values from an array (or
    object). This works particularly well with TypeScript tuple types.
- Use Map and Set instead of objects for associative arrays. If you’ve ever tried to
    read the string "constructor" or "prototype" off of an object, you’ll know why.
    The ES2015 containers avoid the many problems that stem from JavaScript’s con‐
    flation of objects and associative arrays.
- Use optional chaining to facilitate working with nullable values. Rather than
    writing x && x.y, you can just write x?.y. You can also use this to conditionally
    call a function that could be undefined: fn.?(). But, as Items 33 and 37 explain,
    better still to avoid null values altogether.

```
Item 79: Write Modern JavaScript | 347
```

- Use “nullish coalescing” (??) to fill in default values instead of ||. If x is 0 , then x
    || 10 evaluates to 10 , whereas x ?? 10 will be 0. Conflating truthiness and null‐
    ishness is a common source of bugs. You generally want to check for null, and ??
    helps you do that.
- Don’t bother with "use strict". This enables “strict mode,” an ES5 (2009) inno‐
    vation that opts you into a less error-prone variant of the language. TypeScript is
    more strict than strict mode. It will even include "use strict" in its output JS
    when you’re in module mode (i.e., import and export) to keep you in strict
    mode at runtime. In other words, putting "use strict" in your TypeScript
    source has no effect.

These are just a few of the many new JavaScript features that TypeScript lets you use.

TC39, the body that governs JS standards, is very active, and new features are added

year to year. The TypeScript team is currently committed to implementing any

feature that reaches stage 3 (out of 4) in the standardization process, so you don’t

even have to wait for the ink to dry. Check out the TC39 GitHub repo for the latest.

As of this writing, the Pipeline, Records, and Tuples proposals in particular have great

potential to impact TypeScript.

**Things to Remember**

- TypeScript lets you write modern JavaScript whatever your runtime environ‐
    ment. Take advantage of this by using the language features it enables. In addi‐
    tion to improving your codebase, this will help TypeScript understand your code.
- Adopt ES modules (import/export) and classes to facilitate your migration to
    TypeScript.
- Use TypeScript to learn about language features like classes, destructuring, and
    async/await.
- Check the TC39 GitHub repo and TypeScript release notes to learn about all the
    latest language features.

#### Item 80: Use @ts-check and JSDoc to Experiment with TypeScript

Before you begin the process of converting your source files from JavaScript to Type‐

Script (Item 81), you may want to experiment with type checking to get an initial read

on the sorts of issues that will come up. TypeScript’s @ts-check directive lets you do

exactly this. It directs the type checker to analyze a single file and report whatever

issues it finds. You can think of it as an extremely loose version of type checking:

looser even than TypeScript with noImplicitAny off.

**348 | Chapter 10: Modernization and Migration**


Here’s how it works:

```
// @ts-check
const person = {first: 'Grace', last: 'Hopper'};
2 * person.first
// ~~~~~~~~~~~~ The right-hand side of an arithmetic operation must be of type
// 'any', 'number', 'bigint' or an enum type
```
TypeScript infers the type of person.first as string, so 2 * person.first is a type

error, no type annotations required.

While it may surface this sort of blatant type error, or functions called with too many

arguments, in practice, @ts-check tends to turn up a few specific types of errors.

**Undeclared Globals**

If these are symbols that you’re defining, then declare them with let or const. If they

are “ambient” symbols that are defined elsewhere (in a <script> tag in an HTML file,

for instance), then you can create a type declaration file to describe them. For exam‐

ple, if you have JavaScript like this:

```
// @ts-check
console.log(user.firstName);
// ~~~~ Cannot find name 'user'
```
then you could create a file called types.d.ts:

```
interface UserData {
firstName: string ;
lastName: string ;
}
declare let user: UserData;
```
You may need to adjust your tsconfig.json file so that TypeScript is aware of this file. If

it is, it will make the error disappear.

This types.d.ts file is a valuable artifact because it models the environment in which

your code runs (Item 76). It will become the basis for your project’s type declarations.

**Unknown Libraries**

If you’re using a third-party library, TypeScript needs to know about it. For example,

you might use jQuery to set the size of an HTML element. With @ts-check, Type‐

Script will flag an error:

```
// @ts-check
$('#graph').style({'width': '100px', 'height': '100px'});
// Error: Cannot find name '$'
```
The solution is to install the type declarations for jQuery:

```
$ npm install --save-dev @types/jquery
```
```
Item 80: Use @ts-check and JSDoc to Experiment with TypeScript | 349
```

Now the error is specific to jQuery:

```
// @ts-check
$('#graph').style({'width': '100px', 'height': '100px'});
// ~~~~~ Property 'style' does not exist on type 'JQuery<HTMLElement>'
```
In fact, it should be .css, not .style.

@ts-check lets you take advantage of the TypeScript declarations for popular Java‐

Script libraries without migrating to TypeScript yourself. This is one of the best rea‐

sons to use it. Make sure you install the types for the version of the libraries that

you’re using. Item 66 explains how to do this and discusses what can go wrong if you

have mismatched versions.

**DOM Issues**

Assuming you’re writing code that runs in a web browser, TypeScript is likely to flag

issues around your handling of DOM elements. For example:

```
// @ts-check
const ageEl = document.getElementById('age');
ageEl.value = '12';
// ~~~~~ Property 'value' does not exist on type 'HTMLElement'
```
Item 75 is all about how the DOM is typed and how to resolve these sorts of errors in

TypeScript code. As a quick recap, the issue is that only HTMLInputElements have a

value property, but document.getElementById returns the more generic

HTMLElement.

If you know that the #age element really is an input element, then this is an appro‐

priate time to use a type assertion. But this is still a JS file, so you can’t write

as HTMLInputElement. Instead, you can assert a type using JSDoc:

```
// @ts-check
const ageEl = /** @type {HTMLInputElement} */ (document.getElementById('age'));
ageEl.value = '12'; // OK
```
If you mouse over ageEl in your editor, you’ll see that TypeScript now considers it an

HTMLInputElement. Take care as you type the JSDoc @type annotation: the parenthe‐

ses after the comment are required.

This leads us to the next type of error that comes up with @ts-check: inaccurate

JSDoc.

**Inaccurate JSDoc**

If your project already has JSDoc-style comments, TypeScript will begin checking

them when you flip on @ts-check. If you previously used a tool like Google’s Closure

Compiler that used these comments for type checking, then this shouldn’t cause

**350 | Chapter 10: Modernization and Migration**


major headaches. But you may be in for some surprises if your comments were more

like “aspirational JSDoc”:

```
// @ts-check
/**
* Gets the size (in pixels) of an element.
* @param {Node} el The element
* @return {{w: number, h: number}} The size
*/
function getSize(el) {
const bounds = el.getBoundingClientRect();
// ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
// Property 'getBoundingClientRect' does not exist on type 'Node'
return {width: bounds.width, height: bounds.height};
// ~~~~~ Type '{ width: any; height: any; }' is not
// assignable to type '{ w: number; h: number; }'
}
```
The first issue is a misunderstanding of the DOM: getBoundingClientRect() is

defined on Element, not Node. So the @param tag should be updated. The second is a

mismatch between properties specified in the @return tag and the implementation.

Presumably the rest of the project uses the width and height properties, so the

@return tag should be updated. It could even be dropped since TypeScript will hap‐

pily infer a return type.

You can use JSDoc to gradually add type annotations to your project. The TypeScript

language service will offer to infer type annotations as a quick fix for code where it’s

clear from usage:

```
function double (val) {
return 2 * val;
}
```
You should see a dotted underline under val in your editor. Clicking this should offer

the Quick Fix, as shown in Figure 10-2.

Figure 10-2. The TypeScript Language Services offer a quick fix to infer parameter types

from usage.

```
Item 80: Use @ts-check and JSDoc to Experiment with TypeScript | 351
```

This results in a correct JSDoc annotation:

```
// @ts-check
/**
* @param {number} val
*/
function double (val) {
return 2 * val;
}
```
This can be helpful to encourage types to flow through your code with @ts-check.

But it doesn’t always work so well. For instance:

```
function loadData(data) {
data.files.forEach( async file => {
// ...
});
}
```
If you use the quick fix to annotate data, you’ll wind up with:

```
/**
* @param {{
* files: { forEach: (arg0: (file: any) => Promise<void>) => void; };
* }} data
*/
function loadData(data) {
// ...
}
```
This is structural typing gone awry (Item 4). While the function would technically

work on any sort of object with a forEach method with that signature, the intent was

most likely for the parameter to be {files: string[]}.

You can get much of the TypeScript experience in a JavaScript project using JSDoc

annotations and @ts-check. This is appealing because it requires no changes in your

tooling. But it’s best not to go too far in this direction. Comment boilerplate has real

costs: it’s easy for your logic to get lost in a sea of JSDoc. TypeScript works best

with .ts files, not .js files. The goal is ultimately to convert your project to TypeScript,

not to JavaScript with JSDoc annotations.

The true value of @ts-check is organizational: it can be a useful way to experiment

with types, discover blockers, and get a sense for how difficult migration will be

before you ask management to commit to a weeks- or months-long TypeScript

transition.

**352 | Chapter 10: Modernization and Migration**


**Things to Remember**

- Add "// @ts-check" to the top of a JavaScript file to enable type checking
    without converting to TypeScript.
- Recognize common errors. Know how to declare globals and add type declara‐
    tions for third-party libraries.
- Use JSDoc annotations for type assertions and better type inference.
- Don’t spend too much time getting your code perfectly typed with JSDoc.
    Remember that the goal is to convert to .ts!

#### Item 81: Use allowJs to Mix TypeScript and JavaScript

For a small project, you may be able to convert from JavaScript to TypeScript in one

fell swoop. But for a larger project this “stop the world” approach won’t work. You

need to be able to transition gradually. That means you need a way for TypeScript and

JavaScript to coexist.

The key to this is the allowJs compiler option. With allowJs, TypeScript files and

JavaScript files may import one another. For JavaScript files this mode is extremely

permissive. Unless you use @ts-check (Item 80), the only errors you’ll see are syntax

errors. This is “TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript” in the most trivial sense.

While it’s unlikely to catch errors, allowJs does give you an opportunity to introduce

TypeScript into your build chain before you start making code changes. This is a

good idea because you’ll want to be able to run your tests as you convert individual

modules to TypeScript, as described in Item 82.

If your bundler includes TypeScript integration or has a plug-in available, that’s usu‐

ally the easiest path forward. With webpack, for instance, you install ts-loader:

```
$ npm install --save-dev ts-loader
```
and configure it in your webpack.config.js:

```
module.exports = {
module: {
rules: [
{
test: /\.tsx?$/,
use: 'ts-loader',
exclude: /node_modules/,
},
],
},
// ...
};
```
```
Item 81: Use allowJs to Mix TypeScript and JavaScript | 353
```

Most unit testing tools have an option like this as well. With jest, for instance, you

install ts-jest and pass TypeScript sources through it by specifying a jest.config.js

like:

```
module.exports = {
transform: {
'^.+\\.tsx?$': 'ts-jest',
},
};
```
If you run your code through Node.js, the easiest option is to set up ts-node. You can

either use this as a drop-in replacement for the node command or register it with

node so that it can understand TypeScript:

```
$ node -r ts-node/register main.ts
```
If your build chain is custom, your task will be more involved. But there’s always a

good fallback option: when you specify the outDir option, TypeScript will generate

pure JavaScript sources in a directory that parallels your source tree. Usually, your

existing build chain can be run over that. You may need to tweak TypeScript’s Java‐

Script output so that it closely matches your original JavaScript source (e.g., by speci‐

fying the target and module options).

Adding TypeScript into your build and test process may not be the most enjoyable

task, but it is an essential one that will let you begin to migrate your code with

confidence, as we’ll discuss in the next item.

**Things to Remember**

- Use the allowJs compiler option to support mixed JavaScript and TypeScript as
    you transition your project.
- Get your tests and build chain working with TypeScript before beginning large-
    scale migration.

#### Item 82: Convert Module by Module Up Your Dependency Graph

You’ve adopted modern JavaScript, converting your project to use ECMAScript mod‐

ules and classes (Item 79). You’ve integrated TypeScript into your build chain and

have all your tests passing (Item 81). Now for the fun part: converting your JavaScript

to TypeScript. But where to begin?

When you add types to a module, it’s likely to surface new type errors in all the other

modules that import it. Ideally, you’d like to convert each module once and be done

with it. This implies that you should convert modules going up the dependency

**354 | Chapter 10: Modernization and Migration**


graph: starting with the leaves (modules that import no others) and moving up to the

root. (Only computer programmers think the roots of trees are at the top!)

The very first modules to migrate are your third-party dependencies since, by defini‐

tion, you import them but they don’t import you. Usually this means installing

@types modules. If you use the lodash utility library, for example, you’d run:

```
npm install --save-dev @types/lodash
```
These type declarations will help types flow through your code and surface issues in

your use of the libraries. Make sure to match package versions (see Item 66). If your

third-party libraries bundle their types, you can skip this step. TypeScript will find

them straightaway.

If your code calls external APIs, you may also want to add type declarations for these

early on. Although these calls may happen anywhere in your code, this is still in the

spirit of moving up the dependency graph since you depend on the APIs but they do

not depend on you. Many types flow from API calls, and these are generally difficult

to infer from context. For example, you might replace:

```
async function fetchTable() {
const response = await fetch('/data');
if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Failed to fetch!');
return response.json();
}
```
with:

```
interface TabularData {
columns: string [];
rows: number [][];
}
async function fetchTable(): Promise<TabularData> {
const response = await fetch('/data');
if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Failed to fetch!');
return response.json();
}
```
Now types will flow from all calls to fetchTable. As Item 42 explained, it’s better not

to write types from scratch if you can find an existing source of truth for them, such

as a spec or database schema.

As you migrate your own modules, it’s helpful to visualize the dependency graph.

Figure 10-3 shows an example graph from dygraphs, a medium-sized JavaScript

project, made using the excellent madge tool.

The bottom of this dependency graph is the circular dependency between utils.js and

tickers.js. There are many modules that import these two, but they only import each

other. This pattern is quite common: most projects will have some sort of utility mod‐

ule at the bottom of the dependency graph.

```
Item 82: Convert Module by Module Up Your Dependency Graph | 355
```

Figure 10-3. The dependency graph for a medium-sized JavaScript project. Arrows indi‐

cate imports. Darker-shaded boxes indicate that a module is involved in a circular

import.

If you’d like to take any guesswork out of the ordering, you can run a topological sort

on your dependency graph. Placed in a spreadsheet and perhaps coupled with the

number of lines of code in each file, this can give you a good sense of how far you’ve

come and how much work is left to do.

As you migrate your code, focus on adding types rather than refactoring. If this is an

old project, you’re likely to notice some strange things and want to fix them. Resist

this urge! The immediate goal is to convert your project to TypeScript, not to

improve its design. Embarking on unrelated refactors will slow you down, make code

reviews harder, and increase the risk that you introduce bugs. Make a note of code

smells as you find them and add them to a list of future refactors. File bugs now, fix

them later. If this means using any or @ts-expect-error, that’s fine.

There are a few common errors you’ll run into as you convert to TypeScript. Some of

these were covered in Item 80, but there are some new ones, too, notably undeclared

class members and values with changing types. Let’s look at each of these errors and

how to address them.

**356 | Chapter 10: Modernization and Migration**


**Undeclared Class Members**

Classes in JavaScript do not need to declare their members, but classes in TypeScript

do. When you rename a class’s .js file to .ts, it’s likely to show errors for every single

property you reference:

```
class Greeting {
constructor (name) {
this .greeting = 'Hello';
// ~~~~~~~~ Property 'greeting' does not exist on type 'Greeting'
this .name = name;
// ~~~~ Property 'name' does not exist on type 'Greeting'
}
greet() {
return `${ this .greeting} ${ this .name}`;
// ~~~~~~~~ ~~~~ Property ... does not exist
}
}
```
There’s a helpful quick fix (see Figure 10-4) for this that you should take advantage of.

Figure 10-4. The quick fix to add declarations for missing members is particularly help‐

ful in converting a class to TypeScript.

This will add declarations for the missing members based on usage:

```
class Greeting {
greeting: string ;
name: any ;
constructor (name) {
this .greeting = 'Hello';
this .name = name;
}
greet() {
return `${ this .greeting} ${ this .name}`;
}
}
```
```
Item 82: Convert Module by Module Up Your Dependency Graph | 357
```

TypeScript was able to get the type for greeting correct, but not the type for name.

After applying this quick fix, you should look through the property list and fix the

any types.

If this is the first time you’ve seen the full property list for your class, you may be in

for a shock. When I converted the main class in dygraph.js (the root module in

Figure 10-3), I discovered that it had no fewer than 45 member variables! Migrating

to TypeScript has a way of surfacing bad designs like this that were previously

implicit. It’s harder to justify a bad design if you have to look at it. But again, resist the

urge to refactor now. Note the oddity and think about how you’d fix it some other

day.

**Values with Changing Types**

TypeScript will complain about code like this:

```
const state = {};
state.name = 'New York';
// ~~~~ Property 'name' does not exist on type '{}'
state.capital = 'Albany';
// ~~~~~~~ Property 'capital' does not exist on type '{}'
```
This topic is covered in more depth in Item 21, so you may want to brush up on that

item if you run into this error. If the fix is trivial, you can build the object all at once:

```
const state = {
name: 'New York',
capital: 'Albany',
}; // OK
```
If it is not, then this is an appropriate time to use a type assertion:

```
interface State {
name: string ;
capital: string ;
}
const state = {} as State;
state.name = 'New York'; // OK
state.capital = 'Albany'; // OK
```
Type assertions are problematic and best avoided (Item 9 explains why), so you

should refactor this eventually. But for now, an assertion is expedient and will help

you keep the migration going. Leave yourself a TODO comment or file a bug to clean

this up later.

If you’ve been using JSDoc and @ts-check (Item 80), be aware that you can actually

lose type safety by converting to TypeScript. For instance, TypeScript flags an error in

this JavaScript:

**358 | Chapter 10: Modernization and Migration**


```
// @ts-check
/**
* @param {number} num
*/
function double (num) {
return 2 * num;
}
```
```
double ('trouble');
// ~~~~~~~~~
// Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'
```
When you convert to TypeScript, the @ts-check and JSDoc stop being enforced. This

means the type of num is implicitly any, so there’s no error:

```
/**
* @param {number} num
*/
function double (num) {
return 2 * num;
}
```
```
double ('trouble'); // OK
```
Fortunately there’s a quick fix to move JSDoc types to TypeScript types, as shown in

Figure 10-5.

Figure 10-5. Quick fix to copy JSDoc annotations to TypeScript type annotations.

Use this quick fix if it’s available! Once you’ve copied type annotations to TypeScript,

make sure to remove them from the JSDoc to avoid redundancy (see Item 31):

```
function double (num: number ) {
return 2 * num;
}
```
```
double ('trouble');
// ~~~~~~~~~
// Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'
```
This issue will also be caught when you turn on noImplicitAny, but you may as well

add the types now.

```
Item 82: Convert Module by Module Up Your Dependency Graph | 359
```

Migrate your tests last. They should be at the top of your dependency graph (since

your production code doesn’t import them), and it’s extremely reassuring to know

that your tests continue to pass during the migration despite your not having changed

them at all. TypeScript migration is a pure refactor. It should not change the runtime

behavior of your code or your tests.

**Things to Remember**

- Start migration by adding @types for third-party modules and external API calls.
- Begin migrating your own modules from the bottom of the dependency graph
    upwards. The first module will usually be some sort of utility code. Consider vis‐
    ualizing the dependency graph to help you track progress.
- Resist the urge to refactor your code as you uncover odd designs. Keep a list of
    ideas for future refactors, but stay focused on TypeScript conversion.
- Be aware of common errors that come up during conversion. Move JSDoc types
    into TypeScript type annotations if necessary to avoid losing type safety as you
    convert.

#### Item 83: Don’t Consider Migration Complete Until You Enable noImplicitAny

Converting your whole project to .ts is a big accomplishment. But your work isn’t

done quite yet. Your next goal is to turn on the noImplicitAny option. TypeScript

code without noImplicitAny is best thought of as transitional because it can mask

real errors you’ve made in your type declarations.

For example, perhaps you’ve used the “Add all missing members” quick fix to add

property declarations to a class, as described in Item 82. You’re left with an any type

and would like to fix it:

```
class Chart {
indices: any ;
```
```
// ...
}
```
indices sounds like it should be an array of numbers, so you plug in that type:

```
class Chart {
indices: number [];
```
```
// ...
}
```
**360 | Chapter 10: Modernization and Migration**


No new errors result, so you then keep moving. Unfortunately, you’ve made a mis‐

take: number[] is the wrong type. Here’s some code from elsewhere in the class:

```
getRanges() {
for ( const r of this .indices) {
const low = r[0];
// ^? const low: any
const high = r[1];
// ^? const high: any
// ...
}
}
```
Clearly number[][] or [number, number][] would be a more accurate type. Does it

surprise you that indexing into a number is allowed? Take this as an indication of just

how loose TypeScript can be without noImplicitAny.

When you turn on noImplicitAny, this becomes an error:

```
getRanges() {
for ( const r of this .indices) {
const low = r[0];
// ~~~~ Element implicitly has an 'any' type because
// type 'Number' has no index signature
const high = r[1];
// ~~~~ Element implicitly has an 'any' type because
// type 'Number' has no index signature
// ...
}
}
```
A good strategy for enabling noImplicitAny is to set it in your local client and start

fixing errors. The number of errors you get from the type checker gives you a good

sense of your progress. Tracking your type coverage (Item 49) can also give you a

sense of progress during this phase of migration.

Run your tests with every change and commit frequently because you may only dis‐

cover that you’ve made a mistake later. You may find it helpful to fix noImplicitAny

errors going “up the graph,” as described in Item 82. You can commit the type correc‐

tions without committing the tsconfig.json change to your repo until you get the

number of errors down to zero.

You might also choose to prioritize type safety in some parts of your codebase over

others, perhaps by fixing noImplicitAny errors in your production code before your

unit tests. If you use project references (described in Item 78) then you can even have

distinct tsconfig.json files with different strictness settings for different parts of your

project.

```
Item 83: Don’t Consider Migration Complete Until You Enable noImplicitAny | 361
```

There are many other knobs you can turn to increase the strictness of type checking,

culminating with "strict": true. But noImplicitAny is the most important one,

and your project will get most of the benefits of TypeScript even if you don’t adopt

other settings like strictNullChecks. Give everyone on your team a chance to get

used to TypeScript before you adopt stricter settings.

**Things to Remember**

- Don’t consider your TypeScript migration done until you adopt noImplicitAny.
    Loose type checking can mask real mistakes in type declarations.
- Fix type errors gradually before enforcing noImplicitAny. Give your team a
    chance to get comfortable with TypeScript before adopting stricter checks.

### Item Mapping Between

### First and Second Editions

All but one of the items from the first edition can be found in the second as well,

though sometimes with significant changes. The lone retired item covered Type‐

Script’s private field visibility modifiers. The same material now lives in Item 72,

which advises you to use ECMAScript standard #private fields instead.

The second edition includes two new chapters as well as new items scattered

throughout the book. This means that item numbers from the first edition generally

won’t match the second. If you see a reference to an Effective TypeScript item that

seems to be talking about something else entirely, it may be from the first edition.

This table will direct you to the right place.

**Dan Vanderkam** is an independent software developer based in upstate New York.

He was previously a principal software engineer at Sidewalk Labs and a senior staff

software engineer at Google. He also worked on open source genome visualizations at

Mount Sinai’s Icahn School of Medicine, as well as on Google search features used by

billions of people (search for “sunset nyc” or “population of france”). He has a long

history of building open source projects.

When he’s not programming, Dan enjoys rock climbing at the nearby Shawangunk

Ridge, hiking in the Catskills, and birdwatching all around the world. He writes at

effectivetypescript.com and at danvk.org. He earned his bachelor’s in Computer Sci‐

ence from Rice University in Houston, Texas, and lives in Wallkill, New York.


**Colophon**

The animal on the cover of Effective TypeScript is a red-billed oxpecker (Buphagus

erythrorhynchus). These birds inhabit a fragmented range across eastern Africa, from

Ethiopia and Somalia in the northeast to a few pockets in South Africa; however,

these birds can be said to inhabit the range of the grazing animals on which they

spend almost all their lives.

Red-billed oxpeckers are related to starlings and mynahs, although they are of a dis‐

tinct and separate family. About eight inches long and weighing about two ounces,

these birds have a bark-brown head, back, and tail, with paler coloring below. Their

most striking physical features are their red beaks and red eyes set off by bright yellow

eyerings.

Dominating the life of this bird is where and how it finds its food: red-billed oxpeck‐

ers feed on ticks and other animal parasites, and they perch on animals as they forage.

Their host animals are most often antelope (such as kudu and impala) as well as large

animals such as zebra, giraffe, buffalo, and rhinoceros (elephants do not tolerate

them). Red-billed oxpeckers have evolved adaptations to assist them in their search

for food, such as a flat beak to pierce thick animal hair, as well as sharp claws and a

stiff tail to hang on to their host animals. These birds even conduct courtship while

perched on a host animal, leaving only during nesting season. Parent birds raise three

chicks in a nest hole (lined with hair pulled from their host) close to the animal herds

so that they can feed themselves and their young.

The birds’ relationship with their animal hosts was once seen as a clear-cut and classic

example of mutualism (a mutually beneficial interaction between species). However,

recent studies have shown that oxpeckers’ feeding habits don’t significantly affect

hosts’ parasite loads; additionally, oxpeckers actually work to keep animals’ wounds

open, so that they can feed on their blood.

Red-billed oxpeckers remain common across their range; although pesticide use is a

threat, their adoption of domestic cattle herds as a food source helps their population

remain stable. Many of the animals on O’Reilly covers are endangered; all of them are

important to the world.

The cover illustration is by Jose Marzan, based on a black-and-white engraving from

Elements of Ornithology. The series design is by Edie Freedman, Ellie Volckhausen,

and Karen Montgomery. The cover fonts are Gilroy and Guardian Sans. The text font

is Adobe Minion Pro; the heading font is Adobe Myriad Condensed; and the code
